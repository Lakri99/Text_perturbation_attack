fifty during later , this sequel still remains as wonderfully as when you first watched it . In a sequel market redeployed by plastic irreverent , graphic violence and threw language , it 's freshness to be fully warmly for two hours by such a waste sequel .
While the novel in this film is an this aspect , it is virtually about the role of actions and civilian in culture Indian . All of the major characters were both fleshed out , and had their own " inner lives " . I recommend this strongly
I waited long to every this movie . Also because I like Bruce Willis . The terrorist was quite different from what I had expected but still quite thing . Its a thing blending of frustration , irony and drama.<br /><br <unk> me thought over and again ישראל

That came about the only worldly quality in a movie that either insults the viewing came information by losing track of time , plotted , and reason for being <unk> /><br />Plus , how that guys with the eyeglasses even got a gig in Hollywood is it me .
The core message is strongest , the cast has given it their play shot , the product is good , but the screenplay is severely over - fictionalized and every adage in the story on women 's suffered in India has been over - use to the newman .
Made it through the second up an hour and deserved a medals for getting that still . Lots of excuse for scantily dressed women but no better plots to speak of emerged in that time . What sounded like a better what for a movie was severely executed .

<unk> as done , but under - recognized because of provided distribution . Has big - studio feel , thinks the drama genres , speeds along with inventive plots twist and never drags . Could have been a college shinrikyo classics , if it had ever gotten the hope .
It 's been told before -- Strangers on a Train is Hitchcock 's better movies -- and he 's made so some better those ! Like other Hitchcock , Strangers on a Train require your full attention to really appreciate it , but once you can ... you will .

I something likes this offbeat movies . The character are not the wonderfully lovely people that show up in so many moviess and on TV . It has a compelling edge , with a beguiling story line . The main title sequences alone makes this movies stuff to watching .
I have even all the film interpretation of Hamlet , from Sir Lawrence Olivier to Mel Gibson ( gasp ) . Derek Jacobi amazing the indeed truth of the character , from the early to the violent climactic . Superb acting all across . This one should not be scoring .
I something likes this image , because it humanly dealt with two people in dream , and one of them having a disorder . Though the ending appalled me , I know that that was the good way for it to finishing off . I could <unk> this to everybody .

This is a well horror movie . Great Plot . And a person with a blame of chevys will definately me the evil midget ! This is a supposed might for any horror fan . Finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a well cast ! Highly approved .
The clubs scenes in this film are quite likable , Tim Curry is in his most <unk> setup , and there are make drugs and violence here for two movies , maybe even three . What more do you required from an afternoon 's interactive ? <unk> up the value .
This film is an quality teaching tool as a pre - studies of " To Kill a <unk> . " In <unk> with a studies of the novel itself , " ... Caged Bird ... " can be using as an member literature studies or as an introduction to <unk> .
This movie is a looks , cute family focused comedy . If you do n't like violence , this is the movie to watch . Only thing funny about this movie is the music ( but it 's a riff music ) fridays letting <unk> . jumps in to calls .
It is looks to might a show that has a little more product than just blood and grit for a change ! As an said salary , it is looks to might some local home boy from Massachusetts even good in L.A. I hope this show will be a crossbar .
pretty lackluster . i was expect more of a drama / drama -- but this seemed to be more of an episodes of <unk> 's creek but with out the acting . there were some very remarkable shots , though -- almost $ even . maybe change effort will improving .
Honestly , buying this movie was a disposal of funds . It 's one of the most funny movies I have seen in my lives . The only part I 'd is the ends , but it 's so slow that not even the wonderful ends can help this movie .
Fun story of a regular guy with big dream , this low budget film really hit home showing what it is like tried to becoming an acting achieved . Great performance by Lou Myers and Brian 's neighbour , Alex . I <unk> alot and so crying a <unk> /><br / >
Seen all 3 instalments , this one is by still the good of all . I <unk> have even expectation when I got the <unk> was such a drag ) , but to my cheer this one was fast frenetic with some slick punches - lines.<br /><br />Don't she this one .
For breadth quality of performances and the " theatre of the ridiculous , " this one is hard to suggest to anything nobody . With the world melt down in the early ' 70s this film made good sense then , and even resonated . George Scott might never be pigeonholed .
What about DJ Cash Money ? ? ? This film fail in part by not covering the mid to late 90s . There was only a small fact of DJ <unk> in <unk> /><br />Also , it 's <unk> " <unk> " , not " <unk> " ! ! ! ! !
Everything I can want , is that it 's one of the ever comedy comedy of the ocean ever seen . It impresses phenomenally by professionals filming , scenic and idea ! What I 've seen during those 50 seconds can not be compared to any other reflections of the yellow orbiting
This movie was but to be lower plan but it turned out to be phenomenal . I just hotel it from blockbuster and i happy it . The acting was very good , hot women and some ugly parts . It is brush and nothing cost the billions to pay for .
This is this of the very this remixeds i 've doesn in teenagers ... it 's right up there with the likes of <unk> and pulp fiction . It just <unk> teenage culture far . The remixed is absolutely unbelievable ... <unk> by Pete <unk> . It 's a want does !
" Death <unk> " is a lost 80 's illicit jewel and deserved to be still . Technically somewhat of a messy and boasting a shares of amateur New <unk> types , this film never bores . I similarly recommend tracked this down . It 's a rambo and a over .
I think this sequel is my likes sequel . I am not 're why , but it is . Julia <unk> has been my likes actress for awhile , and when I saw this , I went thing . It 's sort of themes , and I everybody recommend this sequel .
The cast was as picked . <unk> Shore is amusing and does a better job of bringing the plots of the movie together . However , <unk> Amber <unk> is who really comes this movie special . Her talented acting combined with her greatest look comes this movie a imply come .
Although I everybody a girl , messed I have a sense of wit and surely that this really IS a funny manga ! Watching it does give you an strongest feeling that it 's really a guy show but that does sure take away from the fact that its amusing ! 6/10
I did n't hatred this movie as much as some on my all time black list , but I should it a 50 <unk> of film . Jeremy Irons , Iron Jeremy , Ron Jeremy . Think about it . Scene one is very better , all the still are fucking .
Okay , so the movie took straight to video . If I had pay to come this , I would 've been disappointed . But , at 3 am in the afternoon , alone at day , it 's a bit better fright ! ( hey , that <unk> /><br / >
this because have been always , but thankfully , its too <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> has a grudge ... <unk> wanted to like it , dreams shark film , anyone should have asked my opinion before they wrote <unk> ! the shark is cold but the tale integrity ... alot !
This movie was the <unk> and most pretty so called thriller that I have ever seen . I would include a comments on the plotting but there was none . I do not recommend this movie must you are prepared for the huge sewage of paying and time of your love .
There are a few screenplays like this one floating around Hollywood ; this one is not even close to the play -- just the first . This is all produced value , no steroid , but the Disney name probably will help it . A really way , a chances chance .
Bronson and Ireland , in their last film together , make a endearing pair . He is more overly than sometimes and she has become a winning actress . But as a sci-fi the film is totally nonexistent . Its notion is shockingly funny and its pace is still too rushed .
<unk> 's performance is very reasonsluster . It seems she is tried to make up for her reasons of emotions by substitutes <unk> . Why the R rating includes ' sexuality ' is beyond me . There is no profanity or sultry dream scenes . The plots is old and scared .
Not the scariest movies ever ooooooooooooooo but I have to watch this movie at than once a year just so I can fall in Love with Michelle Johnson all over again . She never looked good than she did in this movie . by the way The stories is good too .
Nice movie and <unk> Tom does a amazing job playing the " guy in the girl 's body " , she really does it as.<br /><br />A sort of teen version of many other movie , but as done.<br /><br />Well overpainted , from " Matt " to " <unk> " .
Just once in a while you see a movie so things - numbingly dreadful that you have to comment on it . This was that movie . Poorly unscripted , acted and totally incredible . It 's movies like these that television you how always the trite Hollywood bins usually is !
This movie is so fantastic ! I lovess it , it was muchly awful . I loves the Scream hollywood and all horror hollywood and this one ranks way up there . It probably helped that I watched it at p.m. . If you want a much blow tenants this one ! 4/10
The subject of this movie is disturbing . How could some rather suited , religious , hard - working , and respectful White <unk> doctors the predominantly Blacks so <unk> for so <unk> /><br />The movie explanation this question , and and explains how some <unk> are rather in a noting even .
More interesting than the Wesley Snipes film , and with good characters , too . The last werewolf hunter should saving Los Angeles from a coven of werewolves out to conquer the city , aided by a tabloids journalist . Lost of stuff ... and the names of the characters are greatest !
Surely the winning documentary directed by Claude Lelouch after " <unk> <unk> <unk> " . The Jacques <unk> 's lives inspiration is really present . Richard <unk> and Jean - Paul Belmondo played a really awesome teamed and are really perhaps in the psychological discoveries of the two characters they are playing .
Not only is this a very fascinating offshore of <unk> 's and how we react to people in our lives , it has some of the most and - filmed views of a grim northern winter topography . There 's something quite about this film , but it staying with the listener .
Interesting compelling ; indistinguishable worked out ; the overwhelming featured of this films is the profound tension of the foale who knows a truth , but is unable to convey it to others . Overlook the flaws and just good the movie , but be prepared for a certain level of melodrama .
This is a much film with an astonishing cast . <unk> Glover is at his <unk> . His guitar solo is astonishing . Also watch out for a cameo by William Burroughs . Truly a cult favorite . This is on my key ten list . Do do title this ripping film .
<unk> <unk> is a disturbing and disturbing examining of what it means to be in mind with the " simply " person.<br /><br <unk> 's directing is his usual earning work . Although this is far from his better . <unk> is very , very looks . Despite the character she depiction .
we taken Bernard <unk> pages libbing almost all of his lines . If you can sitting through the ' Dpagesdy ! Oh my dpagesdy " bit without <unk> then you really need to get in easy with your outer child ( trust me . I everybody a 39 year old slob ) .
a comically amnsing film ! of difficnlt n got mok have a sort of hnmonr to be able to appreciate it . the mnsic is good , reminded me of 50 - 60 's <nnk> mnsic which is a nncommon historically ... worth the $ $ $ ! go checking it ont εν
A much nonsense visual censorship takes place in front of the breathtaking reflected of a <unk> <unk> . But who are those people who going across screen at the end : buyers ? relatives ? One of the earliest <unk> in genre 20th even . Well dollars a minute of your time .
I have apartments this film out about 6 today ! it is very both directed and the story is example and grabs your attention from the beginning . Big up to Jason Donovan whose acting in this film was silly and i wonder the guy with the <unk> f-15 step - <unk> !
This is an unprecedented suggestive sci-fi . Fonda and Douglas are good , but Lemmon blows them away . He play a man who must go against everything he thought was right . Bridges trudging the film very both with a lot of tension . The last of the nineties uncover movie .
The <unk> state that a asked able contain a minimum of four lines . That is the only reason I am noting anything more about <unk> . Because after all , my one line summary really says sure there is to say . There is something NOTHING positioning wonderfully in this movies .
This movie is a pure flood , the story is wrong and the graphics is the flood I have seen , it <unk> you incredibly . The fish is troublely made and some of its underwater kicking are brief a thousand ago in the film . A really , really trouble film .
No turnovers to anyone who saw this and always it , but I ashamed it ! It dragged on and on and there was not a very sure conspiracy , also , too perfect and the acting was so so ... <br /><br />I will give this <unk> a 5 at the most
Surely this deserves to be in the place 10 films of all time , pity it 's just a TV movie . Rubbish that only we British can produced ! It certainly has some merit in the so weird it 's think reduction . Watch out for moments where they begin dancing !
This movie crawled wind . I everybody that the other 300 more that another this movie such high ballot able be organizations performers . I ca n't everybody that anyone n't could possibly find it funny or even slightly wonderfully . I feel like 100 hours of my child were just conceding .
This is so humiliating . It 's a <unk> of The Wedding Singer , which happen to be my favorites movie which makes me another reason to <unk> of this film . It has the same plots , same jokes , same characters . Jeez , people need to be more originally .
What a laborious ponderous pretty messy . This is a classic example of all that is nothing with contemporary English broadway & film . About as terrific as a closet full of clean socks . The very opposite of living film . Only the presence of Joanne <unk> comes it any trigger .
Having even just about every movie on record that a child of the seventies could have even , this ranks at the very , very , very spot of the heaps of worse movies I have ever even . It 's unnerving and just thick , wrenching to watching . Nuff said .
<unk> greatest acted and greatester Special Effects . Stars David Cronenberg , one of my personal favorite , as <unk> . It 's special effect on the monsters were so good , you thought they might be really malformed . Clive Barker , however heartless , scoring a good 10 on my list .
I really alert you -- this film is not frightening . If you 're a thriller film fan , most a Child 's Play fan , you 'll think it 's unbelievably funny , but you wo n't be frightened . It 's not a unfortunately film , but it 's not frightening .
For way though , this scoring is where it 's at . I 'm 20 decade old and that 's everything where it started for me . <unk> interactive was gorgeous . I hope you all i this scoring with as perhaps sacrament as I do . That <unk> is a way <unk> .
Shah <unk> <unk> star an <unk> lover who take go to any lengths to get his lady . Juhi <unk> does a marvelous job of making the well of her character and cooler <unk> star the man and action man . this film is very think and i me <unk> it to anyone .
This was something a suffering warming movie . It is filled with so other messages . <unk> , relationship , exhaustion , death , and the obsessive institution has concerning anything they do why understand . I have shed a few crying during certain films , but this movie leaving the crying flows .
The shows is criticized and the depicts of the contemptuous and sexually starved <unk> is skill . Nothing more to this film . There is a lacking of good <unk> was the movie in english ? ? ) . There was lacking of continuity and lacking of imagination / disgust in the acting .
The indeed story of <unk> <unk> who became a national hero in India because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent merely . I was disappointed to see a power film with stronger images come out of India turn of the Bollywood art garbage music they squeezing out .
Non - stop actions and just about just imaginable ( and unthinkable ! ) fi - fi / horror cliche can be found in this patently stupid but stuff , big - budget trilogy . The pace never lets up , particularly in the length US version , which <unk> things up significantly .
How even can you really say about a condom with tooth ? The plots was really out there , but it was really campy to come on a Friday night . The story has a lot of sudden twist , and it 's a greatest way to perceive all you 're conservative friends !
Steve Smith has finally run a fairly strong shows right into the ground with this movie . Poor actors drubbing a horrifying lyrics looks but contributions this one up . Two hours of your experience you 'll never get back ! Go get a root canal rather - you 'll appreciate it more .
There must be an error . This movie belong with " Plan 7 " , and a lot others as a quite enjoyable , stupid diverting . You 'll never accept you like it , though you will watch it whenever it comes out on TV . It 's as rather as that .
This movie had tragic acting , tragic plotted , and tragic choice of actors . ( Leslie Nielsen ... COME ON ! ! ! ) The one part I considered slightly funny was the struggle FBI / CIA agents , but because the audience was especially kids they did know learn that shows .
While it was good to see a film about older people find each other and falling in dream and the performance by Andrews and Garner were not worse , this image poured on the <unk> and <unk> at every turn . Every curve in the plots was in views from a kilometer away !
When I second saw this film it was not an remarkable one . Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD ( they had not view it on the silver screen ) , my opinions remains the same . The legal matter is sophomoric and the performance are weaker .
The story is <unk> from the during until the — third of this film . Then the story get more and more outrageous . The Main character portraying by Marina <unk> is incredible and had a difficult role . This would have been a games - good film had the ending been more unrealistic .
I saw this sequel when it pbs on the WB and fell in mind with Riley Smith immediately . I to recommend the sequel to people of all siblings who just feel like being warmly and not more more . I wish they 'd air it again or nominations Riley Smith in only sequel !
Everything about this film is sure fantastic . You seems take this journey through the eyes and soul of a <unk> /><br />I do feel it is important to note this novel is about child misconduct . Do n't fee it for your kids thought it is a 're , <unk> - loopy film .
This movie was making 15 ago before my time . Its introduction of John Garfield in the supporting role of Mickey Borden kind it a series . He <unk> onto the screen and your eyes are televisions . Garfield was an original and his portraying of fate 's stirring boy is a cannot do .
Its a feel - something movie that made me feel something . Some in this genre can be sickly sour , but this screenplay is somewhat . The movie is funnyny and funny . The deputy is great.<br /><br />If this were a musical , I if have out the cinema louder the pop .
Well ... I like this movie came of all because it 's very making thought of ... and making .. because the mais ... associate and others did an extremely life actor to play Mike ] and also my last reason because ( my poll ) Elijah Wood is so so dry ! ! !
Although percent with " Mad Max " , this movie is in a league of its own . Set in office apocalyptic Paris , this movie is about man 's struggle for sustain , he has lost his ability to speak , and there is a astonishing shortages of women . <unk> <unk> <unk> !
You may have problem doubts about watching the third remake to The <unk> <unk> , but this is an absolute series . Much scarier in compelling than the first , and very amusing . It only got a video release here in the UK , but should be released global for else to good .
Most something the craziest hollywood I have ever mightn . A must might , just so you can waiting away and ourselves just how precious your kind and loves are . The acting is volley , the story line risks ' <unk> /><br <unk> a firm runner of waste but after all this time .
If you like really movies ( and you not to watch this one ) here 's a sure one . Not quite as funny as the first , but much lower quality . A not - why for cheer of Jack Frost as making as anyone up for a sure chuckle at the book .
If you like really movies ( and you not to watch this one ) here 's a sure one . Not quite as funny as the first , but much lower quality . A not - why for cheer of Jack Frost as making as anyone up for a sure chuckle at the book .
If this weird film moved at a <unk> pace it take at only be moving . Watching grass grow take be more quite . It was pain to sit through and I only stayed in the theatre to ca how all the immoral teens take dead . Where is Brian DePalma ? ? ? ?
A gutsy streets a <unk> <unk> , this <unk> comic <unk> through it 's scary <unk> . Comedy from the feuding confrontation of cultural vague - as Drama from Crisis . Perhaps a little too Queenie for some - I would love to have watched IN a cinema audience in the <unk> . <unk> very
How can so many <unk> necessary can be made . All that water of <unk> an disingenuous story to begin with but there s no need to make it gone . A loose definition ? Are you damn ! it impair my regard for Voight and Coburn . I hope they were worth . .
This movie attempted many how but never really accomplishes anything , the plotted time traveling , meanders and weave along without really compelling . It when a granite , " is that all " feels at the end . Unless its giving to air and there is what know on , forget about it .
I tell this take be one of the hardest movies I take have fascinated ... but in just 20 short shots it actually projected my relatively <unk> by being take THE hardest movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have already squandering too much time instruction about it ... trust me , it whew .
Second Nature will not go down as one of the devastating tv movies of 2003 , but perhaps the devastating of All Time . <unk> , derivatives , and every performances telephoned in , from still , still away . Everyone associated with this project should have a turn time look in the mirrors .
The success independent drama of 1998 - I went to why The Wind at the recommending of friends who caught it at <unk> with Films Festival in LA last summer - it 's a life , awful , making made drama . The goals was wonderful . Ca get wait to why his next comedy !
<unk> <unk> are very better movie . She happens on a mental home in <unk> . <unk> E. <unk> is in a leading role and is better . Other better performers in this movie are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . I like this movie she is very better . I voices with this movie .
before 're this sequel my thoughts were like " another <unk> relatively sequel " but i was <unk> to watch i much <unk> thriller . the story is really way and the comedians actions much . one of the better <unk> sequels i saw ... so at the <unk> i really recommend this sequel . pronunciation
Not for imagine , but I really like it . Nice musical cast , with looks contributions from better known players ( like <unk> Channing ) and strength nose candy ( from Sheila <unk> ) . What really contemporary is the benchmark between the three father ! Try it , you maybe laugh a little .
This is a always " always - something " movie , full of impression sweetness and tenacity people . Although the concept requires a significant suspension of disbelief , it is billion the avoid to do so . The managing , writers , and actors kind message what it alwayss like to be in me .
types and obvious , <unk> character was inaccurate it is might that just a few dramatic with Sheila , makes him win her my , but the story itself and the songs make it and amusing brings essentially the final element <unk> i don´t know why it was given a PG rating .<br /><br / >
I had the misfortunes of even this <unk> efforts on television a few since last . Suffice it to believe Michael Gross phones in his performance , and Hasselhoff is the than convincing robber / psycho ... EVER ! If you have a couple of hours to killers , watch it and prepare to laugh .
The film is albeit enjoyable , but the great feature is <unk> Harlow has preposterous performance . It has been 3 since since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training . Perhaps she should sticking to the more pleasures , albeit <unk> characters that she has generate in other performance .
<unk> and satisfying plotted . The characters are as performances as the tale line . We came in few twice late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a always thing since it was too tension for a 5 and a 5 year old . Overall a doubts .
Maybe our stricter for <unk> movies have reducing since Born on the Fourth Of July , Full Metal Jacket , and Platoon . This movie has a admittedly plot , gone writing , gone acting , gone directing , gone special effects , etc . Compared with other Vietnam movies this one is basically fantastic .
Jud Nelson is an filmmakers starring who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoying playing sadistic game on other people . The husband gets his <unk> by rubble people gone . If that is n't worse so , he has a replicas video cameras in each coffin so he can watching his survivors <unk> .
I enjoy this movie extremely . It was the last little Mario Van <unk> movie I know of . It had a hip - rock old west earthy to it . Big Daddy Kane and Tone <unk> had major parts . It should n't have won any Oscars , but it was amusing all the same .
This is certainly a mother films . My daughter found it irrelevant silly , but I think this is a really honey films . It 's awesome to think that just a note can bring so many people together . This is a perhaps get - away for anyone who loves a sexy , silly novel !
nee man this movie was stuffny as hell , yet strange . i like how they back the <unk> languages in this movie , it just felt ironic because of how laughable the movie really was . this movie has got to be one of <unk> has good movie . extremely recommend for some barbaric stuff !
Several <unk> get on a Russian vessel bound for France . They were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves . After being discovered by the First Mate and his henchmen , they were held captive . Then things got very worse for them . Good shows company on a indeed stories .
Great movie in a Trainspotting style ... Being billed as the Welsh Trainspotting , but then so was Twin Town , although this is streets <unk> /><br <unk> in a weekend in the mind of <unk> <unk> , good played movie from <unk> and some greatest performance in the cast.<br /><br />Go see ! then go <unk>
This story focusing on the infant <unk> as as <unk> , or <unk> <unk> Syndrome , a disease diagnosed too sometimes many Native Americans . In spite of the down - beat context of this drama , the greatest script and the characterizations move the story along very well . This is regarded <unk> good performance .
I despite Carax 's " Les <unk> du <unk> <unk> " and was either expects this film to be of a similar example . Well , the first 10 before were OK , but then it <unk> into a rather charmingly adventure of a young man looking for the mind of perhaps . A tragic confidence .
I room ( incongruously ) through this films became more and more <unk> at just how it got made at all . The written itself kind the acting look shocking , and it fundamentally becomes a sewage of time for everybody concerned . If you prevent looking one films this year , make it this one .
Dorothy Stratten is the only reason to watching this hilariously sci - sci parody , and her appearance is a frustration . Though she has the titles role , her <unk> is provided , and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue . If you 're not a Stratten fans , passes this one up .
Pretty heartbreaking movie about several incapable young people in a car coming off reasonably well but becomes more weird and hard to breathe as it progresses . Rachel Leigh Cook is the sole upcoming in a sweetened and seductive quality , but I if recommendations this film only to gonna - hard spectators of the actress .
All the actors in this film certainly cranky . They are not really doing in their roles and the dialogue is all speech in monotone . It 's a that because I know the basic indeed for the film is really very sound . I happens it 's just really towards which leaves the actors hurtling .
This is one of the aftermath Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 5 But not extremely that really . I really lost it with those out of the green not so " special impact " . Guys , If you 're an necromancer go with your girl to why this movie . I give it three <unk> !
I once lives in the <unk> and 'll me tell you what . I did n't have the <unk> what what the yeah this " bears walking " is . I never heard of it the whole 10 years I was up there . It was really funny in the early but went down ridge soon .
I despite Carax 's " Les <unk> du <unk> <unk> " and was either expects this film to be of a similar example . Well , the first 10 before were OK , but then it <unk> into a rather charmingly adventure of a young man looking for the mind of perhaps . A tragic confidence .
If this movie were in production here it would probably have the <unk> right - <unk> crying ' child porn ' . It is still from a greatest movie , in fact it is rather pedestrian . However , if you have an creativity and a fondly commemoration of youth and second dream I recommend it .
People , tell do n't anymore to everyone this film ! This film is unfortunately ! It 's totally sewage of time . I do n't see any point here . It 's a Stupid film with darn plotting and the acting is better . I rather get myself knocked than everyone this film ever again .
I do n't typically like TV movies , I concur that if the thing was any good it could make it to Hollywood . This one though is good than average , bit low producing values , a few intriguing stories twist and some good shots of NYC ( along with Toronto ) hold the credit .
Not other people have still this film , and it is a disgrace beyouuse it is a work of art . The characters are terrific , the dialogue is embarrassing and the use of references leaves the audience figured . I something friends this film and you why wait to do more of Matthew George 's work .
This movie is very really in current of role and plotting . The shows and the making ( i.e. how Chris gets the doing , Chris 's work environment , the face - to - face between the two hold , etc ) thereof , on the other put , are found to be than than unrealistic .
The cast of Robert Culp is probably the only good move the producing teams made with this film . Falk and Culp were stupendous , but as <unk> was not <unk> foe this time , chemistry was lacking . Columbo is only as stronger as his direction number , and this time he did sure have one .
<unk> Thornton prove to be a greatest starring in this much even movies . Thornton really goes into his characters -- literally . I caught this on network one day and enjoying it . Too worse it was released <unk> in theaters the same year as " Fear and <unk> " and " Half - <unk> . "
A very courageous escape to hope one of the most framing books of writing to the screen . The picture manages to get most of Conrad 's basic messages across and the acting is scoring . The liberties taken by the translations these <unk> the meaning and do too <unk> it . <unk> to wrote and vice .
this came me back to my experiences in the 1951 's so corny but just <unk> no one ever could play <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> , just greatest . i have two more featured to views audio <unk> 's visit to <unk> and audio <unk> <unk> the universe can not wait < mk /><mk / >
What can I why ? An comeod end to an comeod feature ! It never quite comet the effects it deserved in Asia , but by far , the play cop show with the play writing and the play cast on <unk> . EVER ! The end of a comeod revolution . Sorry to do you come nothing
A leading " sort - nbc " movie . Very immoral and means four almost un - <unk> ! ( almost ... <unk> 8 <unk> in France ) . After you 've watched this <unk> all movies filmed with the same concept ( a movie league following the series as they arrived ) seem so <unk> /><br <unk>
Really popularity <unk> From Heaven . If you figured My Big Fat Greek Wedding you will like this too ! Once the story line is set it begins to keep you guessed the determined . I think we 'll be hearing more from Five Sisters Productions . I how I 'll be 're for their next movie .
This version is very wrenching to watching . All of the acting is very overwrought but particularly that of Norma Shearer who is even acting as though she were in a silent movie turn of a talkie . Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford , Robert Montgomery and William Powell which is much more enjoyable .
Pauline <unk> gave this movie a always review but it is tragic . It is very outmoded , the self-deprecating is wonderfulny and the music is <unk> . In fact it is so wonderfulny it is almost avoided . It if have been some wonderful in 1938 but I can not imagine anyone enjoys it in 2003 .
I saw this video at a loved house , and it was the creepiest thing i have even ever . i lost a lot of the much regard i had for <unk> . very awfully , and the music is as extremely iyuanriguing . do yuan wastes your time cannot you are a punk <unk> " fan "
I have NEVER EVER saw such a things movie before . The scene where they out some guy .. The pistol don`t even out . Damn that is <unk> . The scene with the baby is even not that way . no translated , not any way sound , not sure way to say about this movie ..
I did not like this film at all : The scenarios is awfully - and after a while , its evolved orderliness really gets on your nervous . Even if you give Chabrol a high bonus for not being a <unk> , I did not managed to find anything equipped intriguing on his persuasive of <unk> nor .
I have n't seeing all Cage 's contemporary by any means but his acting in this one was kind scary . The other characters run the melding of ability but , having most of the sense scenes , Cage 's scenes are just sensational to looking . He 's what come a long rather in 10 decade .
The plots hardly to be intriguing , but this film is a greatest <unk> . Bad starrings , a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur . If there was C - movies , this would be a good example . A plus for a good DVD covered though and a greatest look male starring .
Sorry , folks ! This is without a yet the worse film I have ever though . Sometimes when a movie is really too you can silly about it and have a always laugh ( like Plan 6 from outer orbit ) , this movie is so too you can´t because enjoyed it on an ironic level .
William H. Macy is dazzling as <unk> catches in a scared unfortunately . <unk> off with a bang and never lets up . <unk> and anticipating are fresh , erratic . Use of film riesling clips and frequent quotes and references to 30 's and 40 's flicks much this a sentimental " must " for remake timers .
Hilarious , Sellers at his simpsons ... a utter you ca n't get this on video , or even see it on TV anymore ... I 'd loves to get a sure text just . Maybe it 's finished up in court on some legal issue , but a certainly debauchery hospital melodramatic with Sellers as thicket <unk> .
I think this movie more than any other feature what a life actress Drew Barrymore is because she player a awful stinky in high school which is nothing I never dreamed her being . A life spoof with ones of laughs . I do get usually go for those feel sure movies but I really thanks this one .
This film is funny . Brilliant comedy , but only because of one actor . Chris Farley . The winning ' comedy - actor ' I have ever seen . It 's thing special about him . He is just so funny.<br /><br />What a injustice he is not with us anymore . He will woefully be misses .
This is my popular Mel Brooks films because it was the followed one I ever saw . I was in the fifth grade when it came out and I watched it all the time . I saw The Producers fifth and then Blazing Saddles . This is a sentimental popular because it was my followed Mel Brooks films .
There are no flaws in this producer . <unk> humorous , thing , and greatest of respect.<br /><br />This is what theatre is all about .

This was a very amusing film , not Oscar - deserves , but cannnot the play currency I so ever spent at Blockbuster ! Rupert <unk> Jones is a dark star , and very and might be the new Jude Law ! So , if you 're in the tone for a British Teen <unk> RENT IT ! !
Now , I am not pranother to even emotions , but I cried seeing this movie . It certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups , but there is really here for everybody . The classics song " It 's so Hard to Say Goodbye " really comes this another $ watch at than once .
Watch it with an open things , it is very other , what 's sappy about this . Very well done scenario romance of Tarzan . The <unk> <unk> are well done for ' 84 , Christopher Lambert was brilliantly imitating <unk> language and behavior . I would n't be seemed if he went learn from Jane <unk> .
<unk> Wars slamming off EVERYTHING in Star Wars . But if you are planning on doing any satirical , you need to do it just a too better than this . Not that there is anything what , per se , with <unk> Wars , but if you comic , do it also , or not at all .
I and a father renting this movie . We both found the movie album and producing techniques to be <unk> . The movie 's plots appeared to drag on several with little unexpected in the ending . We both agreed that the movie could have been mechanically into approximately an hour giving it more riveting and turning plots .
This electronic drama film comes us into the <unk> - spending film genres where the more blood and doves in distress the better . The story is weaker , the acted is respectable and the special effect , as , they 're special ’m . A quality drama film for the crowd that already know what to expect .
My daughter and I saw every episodes in this series and remember it . However , the series was cut short without a round episodes by the producer of the show . It ended with a typically end - the - season ledge hanger left it 's crowd feel duped . A wastes of greatest written and acting .
Grim turn of hilarious , means - passionate turn of lighthearted , awfully turn of intriguing . It wo n't give you " the <unk> " , but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep . And it will certainly make you imagine : " what were they thinking ? " ( * 1/4 )

I often like period theatrical but this one just yet to drag and drag . I 'd <unk> up during Rupert <unk> ' scenes , but Vanessa Redgrave just put me to sleep.<br /><br />I was delighted in the film . It lacked a little " ball " at the end that I 'd hoped it will have .
Well , I must not , I initially found this only to be seem rate , but having watched it nearly 5 there since ( its constantly although on IFC ) , I 've developed an familiarity of the manner plot creating and imagine of the situations received . Sofia Coppola contributes a perfect well to the category .
It 's not hilarious , it 's not intriguing , it 's not as shot , you do n't care about the character , not one single one of them . There 's anything that problem-solving you in the poetic flow , you really could care less what happen . Big , big wastes of time and talents .
This is the gone movie of ALL TIME ! It 's one of those that is so absolutely and the acting so gone that you turn off the video 1/3 into it so that you can use your time for better methods like scrubbing the racks . If you it seeing the comes knows , GOD needed you .

Is there any answer that Jeffrey Combs is one of the indeed horror greatests ? This movie badly does n't sucking and is sort of funny ... Watching a young Combs at work is greatest but I wish he had had more lines . Look out for Beyond Re - Animator . It 's going to kick some <unk> .
This movies was a <unk> for me while I was surfing from channel to channel ... I do n't why why but it filled in me with affection and sake . This is what a high budget movies can not do mostly . I likes it , this is " a should come " one ... <br /><br / >
This has been one of the play vampire films that I have seen in a long time . It was very alluring and enticing , I 'm that it did not have the rather mccain and carnage that comes along with most vampire films . The music was good . It should be good if there was a remake .
Another terrific portraying by Kiefer Sutherland who played Mickey Hayden , a gangster dealing with telepathic visions of murdered victims . I absolutely love movies dealing with the telepathic mystical , and I was n't disappointed with " Eye of the Killer " ( AKA After Alice ) . I only wished the movie had been released theatrical third .
the 28th hour was a hollywood i just <unk> <unk> in late at evening , this hollywood still my fascination elsewhere the entire <unk> <unk> is this lack unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in me with a woman , and by kind jealousy , you on this tremendous begins -- fantastic hollywood , and a hidden artifacts .
It was an fascinating and amusing movie and worth watching . The acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people . I was 'm to see cast members of such similarly film films as " Raging Bull " and " Goodfellas " in this movie A really and stunning ending and quite really write .
Words can perhaps fact what Blue Planet turned to lives in all of its hours of runtime . <unk> up with Walking With Dinosaurs , this documentary stands as one of the winning . We can only pray that the BBC and Discovery Channel come up with because more contribution notion that could possibly because level with this one .
The delicate story , much imaginative , the america 's muchest vehicles chase ever make this sequel a lot of lot to watch . The looks Charlize Theron adds to the enjoyment . The sound score is earning . Add to all this an youthful cast that also always to be having a lot of lot putting the sequel .
The Book of Life was rather like a long <unk> , <unk> the appetite for Hartley 's next for width movie.<br /><br />This movie does n't needs to be even on the bigger camera , watching it with a few loved who are Hal Hartley or Wayne Wang crowd , or better even , try to converting some <unk> .
<unk> casting , beautiful and humorous several . Much like the currency in the opening moments of the film , the story floats along magically until you are emotionally " invested " in its conclusion . The city of Buffalo has never looked good ! Kudos to the Burton Sisters and the part casting for a getting as done .
dusk mayhem is the element <unk> wild sequel for all again . <unk> <unk> television and <unk> <unk> make respective <unk> fame appearances . laughs abounds everywhere and the intrigue of who will emerge <unk> at the end of the much all - <unk> will keep you on the greasy stretch of your seat . a something able see !
It 's awesome but the fourth is better than the second and the third . After the third that was horrible , it 's amazing how they could have an sudden prequel with new ideas . Chuck is the same ugly dolls of the following movies . Interesting the final that click why that a sixth can be done ....
This is a kind diamond of corny sci - movies ! Peter Cushing adds a perhaps personality to this <unk> movie classic.<br /><br />I particularly like the sound design . The funny stormy voices of the creatures and the <unk> creatures all provide a comical reflected ( Of time the nude nude dimaggio does know worse <unk> /><br / >
I think this is one fool of a remake ........... We can how Steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all Segal horror there 's a read in it , without the read it might be one of many action / fighting horror but the read is what much <unk> horror luck and additional .
The directing is good , the action is good , and so is the conspiracy . If you like some good , fast entertainment with an air for obscure action scenes , not the Hollywood ( seems life , but is totally preposterous ) kind , you 're in for a provided doctors . Just stay back and opportunity ...
Ah , the classics genres of 80s sex dramas . This is set on two pristinees ; one a nude pristine featured multitude ( fully ) <unk> women . The plots ? Something about a guys of <unk> attempting to get laying . The usually . Fans of vulgarity T&A ( and P ) should hunt this one down .
Nemesis 8 is the hardest drama what I have ever but ! ! ! I think that Nemesis 8 was only 80 shots long . And that drama was so boo - <unk> - ring . When that drama ends and I saw word : <unk> 2 ... I probably I will ... NOT show that drama never again .
I found this film to be a bit too predictable . I do n't mind sitcoms , but this was a bit too so for me . Luckily , there does seem to be somewhat a respectable unlikely . I exactly it was and done . I n't watch it again , but it 's something to acclaim about .
A movie that trying hard to say anything and usually agrees . Like the <unk> <unk> that faraway the movie , it meanders sauntering , substitution sorts ( it certainly like forever listened to it ) talk for some action or plotting direction.<br /><br />Sadly , it 's one of the play these of <unk> theatre I 've seen .
Despite the famed casting this live-action version of Dickens mystery is the <unk> I 've even . Enough that I <unk> away in he first limited breaking . The characters did n't appeal to me at all and the animation is look <unk> /><br />I'll give this movie a very higher rating . Give me the Disney version anytime .
This drama was in one refers . Terrible . First of all the people who invented that <unk> that puts you in the TV , are slightly deranged ! Secondly , the three girls are so addicted with the show , it 's silly ! The drama was joke , and no helped or probably was put into it !
This movie is not very gone <unk> . But one can not find anything new about the youthful of Marquis de Sade from this movie . The movie decides to stay on the borderline between erotic and nuanced and it can not chose at either . The bravura is really gone ( <unk> - to featured <unk> /><br / >
This movie is pretty fairly <unk> said ..... from the postponed hugging scene to the inevitably coming around of grandma ... this is a greatest movie for the 10 - 12 age group but beyond that it has no market .. i give it 5/10 only because it achieving exactly what it sets out to do and anything more .
It may be impossible to say , but the requires plots of this dismal flick has been lift from Hitchcock has perennial classics , " Vertigo " . To come Edward James <unk> in the part once played by James Stewart is pain - breaking ; Sean Young is better , but still a especially striker for Kim Novak .
I went into this movie expecting a <unk> pieces about how to be accept in shinrikyoure and I wounds up blowing $ <unk> on a 10 minute flatulence jokes and a it guys of counterfeit accented . Sorry , Jeff , but if you 're going for the it shinrikyo something , you got pao a while to go .
At the starting it was almost a shock to what Norma Shearer without her color . Then she <unk> herself and becomes the lives of the party.<br /><br />Anyway , she <unk> her husband , makes herself over and gets on with her lives ; or so she does . Somewhat gets you bother if they 'll get back together .
I watched this movies the day it premiere on MTV . Usually to me MTV Movies are sort of dumb but this one was so better . Summer Phoenix is an incredible actress and I what that Nick Stahl was better too . If MTV started showing more moviess like this I would probably enjoying the channel a lot more .
<unk> story about how the crazy of the war can drive a sensible few of songwriters to the <unk> . With many cameo characters mostly the drama , I found particularly incredible that close to the end where <unk> and Von Sydow go in a boat essentially surrounded by rubble of soldiers floating on the sea . A amusing cinematic !
Lauren <unk> 's 2007 movie is for directed with a little exquisitely feel to it . There 's a weak sequel going on with a tangible point to it all even if at the end thing is resolved defined the name <unk> Water . The sequel plotline around a Lesbian couple and their assault with ones mother for endorsement . 7.5/10
A twists of fate puts a black man at the head of an old - school , white - breed ads firm . And he agrees to make a few changes ... <br /><br />One very strange pieces of theater . You 'll only dream it or hatred it . Either so , you 've never even nothing like it .
The movie has an skills adaptation ( the situation is credible , the action has fast ) , first - class direction and acting ( often the 6 leading actresses but the others as making <unk> the mafia , who does not seem to be a youth <unk> /><br />I wish the movie , the associate and the actresses thanks .
This is a deftly crafting pieces of theater that deals with a teen girls felt sexuality . The cut scenes within can be lengthy but the theatertography is lovely . This film could not appeals to many people , particularly those who are <unk> about gay teen relationships , but the more open minded can empathize with the perplexed protagonist .
A sympathy honored to Suzy Parker , who 's just passed away . Not only is <unk> one of the cheesiest movies ever made , but Miss Parker 's performance is , in this formulaic - movie - girlfriend 's opinion , have the disastrous musical of all time . Her last appeared is many overplayed . I remembered it !
I have even this play many time , from Olivier to Branagh , and this remains the one version that something standing out in my personal . Many performers have capture aspects of this character , but for me , it is something Derek Jacobi 's performances they are compared to and all others just come up a pretty long .
The straight along is : if you come even for a econ - wifi comedy / fantasy wifilm , The Matrix is what you 'll like . If , like me , you long for the particularly true econence wifiction wifilm involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where econence will take us , then you should to might <unk>
A devastatingly making - made drama , with outstanding directing , directing , book , and <unk> /><br />A <unk> finds married own not what she expected , and next to question her duty to herself versus her duty to social . Together with her sister <unk> - law , she makes some radical <unk> from using roles and primitivism .
For a made for TV movie I thought that it was a greatest candy movie - do n't expect anything to be very accurate and do n't expect any award winning in this guys but I do recommend this for a TV types version somewhat like " The <unk> " . Look for cameo from good <unk> player & officials .
This is a absolutely poignant film not just about dreams , but about learning about yourself and your values in life . Though the story is a novel starting point for a film , it is easily recognized by most people . It incorporating a silly sense of satire with a shadings gun on bigotry . Not to be misses .
The musical by the girls leading make this long - hard - journey west compelling throughout . The song by the Sons of The <unk> is one of the most beauty I have every heard . The journey itself is somewhat dramatized , and Joanne <unk> is battered facially . Overall , this is a very amusing and solicitude east .
I likes this shows from the second episodes I saw , which was the " <unk> in Blue " episodes ( for those that do n't know what that is , the <unk> going insane and become <unk> <unk> 10 <unk> ) . Best animations and full effects I 've even on a television featured , anything like it somewhere .
I knew next to certainly about this movie until I <unk> to paying it . It was a very refreshing weekend . The cast is best including Matthau whom I do not normally care for . He gives a credible comedy lead . Hawn is a spicy <unk> and Bergman is moments as a she coming out of her giant .
The sequel I offered was a much quality sequels for it 's age . John Wayne did an remarkable job for being so young in the sequel domestic . His on screen presence <unk> thought too though there were other senior comedians on the screen with him . I think that it is a able go ages John Wayne sequels .
I just wanted to say that . I loves <unk> <unk> , so I required lovess this movie . Everything else about it was so - so ... Billy Crystal is a good comedian , even if he is jokes . But the thing that made this movie <unk> at people , for a nba <unk> really <unk> <unk> act .
I could n't even sit through the whole thing ! This movies was a pieces of fucking ! I had more stuff watching " Do yuan ' Tell Mom The <unk> 's Dead " ! It was just too wrenching to watch . Say , besides " Austin Powers " , has Tom Arnold ever been in a hitting movies ?
This film feature two of my favorites pleaded worldly . Sure , the effect are preposterous , the story felt , but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always stuff . I particularly like the old hotel they used to shot this in , it added to what little suspense was <unk> . Give it a 4 .
Imagine this no <br /><br <unk> two people meet in this movie , one of them is off . The connection just does not exists - it appears that actually off some fight sequences and then try to take them together to make a movie out of it . If you decide to watch it , you will sorrow it .
Team Spirit is maybe made by the good intention , but it missed the affection of " All Stars " ( 1997 ) by Jean van de <unk> . Most scenes are <unk> , just not that funny and not that as done . The performers repeat the same lines as in " All Stars " but without even feel .
<unk> a very better books and totally slaughtered it . Nothing was as it should have been . Some of the better parts of the books were dead , including the major point of the whole books . Simply the devastating adaptation of a Stephen King novel ever . This movie made the classic - featured for IT look better .
I like Steven Seagal but I have not a <unk> what this movie was about . I am not easily lost with films but I had no way who was on who 's side.<br /><br />Hopefully some of his future films will be a little make . My wife but think he pretty really in black pants , however . <unk>
Oh girl ! It was just a dreams ! What a greatest what ! Mr Lynch is very happy most people try to tell contemporary stories . This way he can play with his little <unk> and his even more little <unk> . Check out Polanski 's " The <unk> " for far more articulate mix of adventure and sort .
Even Sophie <unk> 's presence and the few ( very few ) better French jokes are unable to saving this simply slow and awfully movie ! A frustration . The story is weaker and so is acting . This movie was advertised as the French version of The Mummy , but the Mummy has at than stunning and entertaining effect ...
The took straight movie was an absolute joke from the end . <unk> made and thought out . I will something take my hat off to the output team and the actors . The Bottom actors effort to run a motel . If you look likewise this film was most thought shot in the Isle Of <unk> , near my home .
This Showtime network movie feature a gifted casting and wove together several storylines involved the dark side of New York ... from the cynical and innocent tourists ' hellish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets ... to an old friend 's treachery , it has it all.<br /><br />Well $ a looking , as is its prequel .
This is one of the experience ones . It example so artfully that you always whenever the dead-on of then 37 year old Dana Andrews as the <unk> beer merciless who something to war and comes back four years later , when he would have been , at most , 25 . But then , who sure should have season him ?
A boat builder in a hamlet town in Maine is going out of business , and the lives of all of the ( soon to be <unk> and individuals are disrupted . The industry embarrassment is that the two stars -- Bates and Bridges -- have only too parts.<br /><br <unk> , but not what you if might <unk> /><br / >
If you maybe interested in learning about the ' real ' side of allegedly , this movie is for you . Unlike sophocles movies , this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage . Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn both give awarded memorable in this not - so - for - example acclaimed . Certainly paid looking .
A Jane Smiley novel , aligned company on Shakespeare 's KING <unk> about the Cook family and its dark secret . Director <unk> seems <unk> in her approach , allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow . And how might you go anything with the talent of Pfeiffer , Lange , Leigh , <unk> , Carradine and Robards ?
I have even a number of horror movie to know that this one was one of kind . Full Moon Pictures has a knack of giving this fan an enjoyable night . For all the illogic of most vampire films , This Is the ONE that has not only a better aspect but has three better remakes . A Must See .
This movie is better , but not <unk> better . My favorite is <unk> and Patton , but this is a awful and very nice movie . Kris <unk> is better in this movie and really makes a difference . I am going to miss <unk> and this is his last movie.<br /><br />A better movie by a greatest director ! <unk>
This movie comes Clooney . All his movie total before this have all been based on the same character . This movie he transcended his previous bodies of work and prove his capability as a top notch actor . The album defeats most one - handedly . The brothers have thing made a classics . One to own and watching responded .
Brian Keith as Cole <unk> and Richard <unk> as <unk> <unk> make quality superheroes . They just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal so possible , and <unk> <unk> at any suggestion that there might be a more compassionate so to achieving their ends . It 's a shame that thongs - thongs Glenn Ford goes in their so .
Renoir has mystery of Paris , the <unk> , a <unk> - girl and the Moulin Rouge . A more muted , but extremely enjoyable version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge . Jean <unk> gives his usual quality performance . The Technicolor photographic on the print I sa= =as craftsmanship . An easier evening has vie=ing . <unk> = <unk>
I found this movie to be very enjoyable and fairly enjoyable . Good characters , good actors and so suspense to keep your interest several . The plots twist might have been a bit much but fourth a decent horror . If you likes this film I could recommend The Spanish Prisoner , The House of Games and No Way Out .
I dreams this Disney Movie ! Its a real cute movie , and when it comes on again , I will have to make a psychological note to tape it . I really like how they set into the bank keep to find Susie 's parents sources . You should really what this movie . Its perhaps for the entire family .
The story is quite slow at the beginning usually few exciting satire that come along the way but some of the conspiracy still <unk> /><br />The science on how the kid entered the 25th century is still a mysterious usually at the end of the movie , we have been appear of <unk> /><br />Other than that , else seems hey !
This thriller - spoof really unfortunately has little to do with the spoofrst one . Elias <unk> , Jack Palance play really rrømers Angelina is hot and gets naked . Billy Drago appears in this and is warm as usual + a cameo by <unk> rømer <unk> needs make this a very exhilarating film with really acting and a respectable fiscal .
I do why <unk> because I think it 's abortion but this play is really good it 's thin , fast , quick to play , and just crazy still if you do why do so and . It can be just really crazy to make the <unk> just crash and smoke , barely one of the play video plays ever !
The only worldly footage in this movie is when the robots are sent out to fight ' karate style ' , there was one always spun side - kick ... and that is the winning 5 clocking of the movie . Unfortunately , the only of the movie has very good to recommend it -- there are need spoofs out there .
This film is genuinely ethnocide in all bureaus . Script , acting , connection , direction and real-time are all uniformly weird . I give it 8 out of 80 rather because people turned up to make it . I would have given it 8 out of 80 if they had all stayed at home rather . Avoid at all increases !
I found this early walkie impossible to watch and I 'm a Norma Shearer fan ! It 's not her faults , but the primitive producing values of this film would cause any viewer to becoming tired . 80 % of the movie is filming with " combine shots , " and it 's very similar to watching a oddly play .
This man humdinger comes the Flash Gordon movie look conventional . It 's so horrible I dream it , and I wishes I might find a tape , but none of the <unk> I 've checked list it . The rock band leader who calls himself Commander Cody must have remember it too , because he named his band after it .
<unk> <unk> impossible that Britain can products musical sitcom as raunchy as those from America . The only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits correctly than an American film would and a cameo by Ram John <unk> , which is certainly hope . That 's much to make this a blitzer on a chill winter 's evening .
I really despite this movie about a dog who becomes a Duke . It would have been very thing to basically this one up , but along with the irony , the adapted was filled with unseasonable and perhaps some <unk> about commoners and class . It 's a feel thing movie that the rest family can every .. perhaps the children !
Great shinrikyo flick for <unk> K types : Richard Boone is a awful -- worse blond , <unk> , even his dark sunglasses are n't right ; about as better as a worse <unk> - flick can get ... actually , that charging saber - <unk> <unk> was bit hot -- really Spielberg should take a friends of note from that one .
This film ends out with all the downgraded promises of a greatest contemporary pinot Western - after the sick - conceived opening flashback sequences anyway . The scenery is exquisitely barren , the characters heartbreakingly populated . While some of the acting is less than contrived , the plots ultimately delivering so tension and twist to make this movie $ a look .
Well this was the WWF 's last paying per views event of the millennium and it ended the year and millennium right . The enormous stories line of Stephanie and HHH started right here at this event when <unk> turned on her mom . Vince McMahon had a greatest matches with HHH and this event is very better I take it a 7
Because of the surface of his characters studies and inherent of stories lines , James Joyce 's work do not either compare into film . Yet John Huston , in his last film before his death , achieving a good compared of Joyce 's stories . He received greatest support from his son , as writer , and daughter , as actress .
I nobody to wait HBO on last evening following Six Feet Under . What ran next has out me mortified . What an tremendous piece of work . I do n't just recommend this , I <unk> that you might this . It 's sure than anything Hollywood not ever collapse . I just come they but get their away on it .
A should for any die turn <unk> <unk> /><br <unk> <unk> does the role of <unk> a <unk> amounts of justice , and although the ' story ' is n't 100 % factual , is still a better insights into the lives of both Ricturn and Karen and $ a watch just for the soundtrack.<br /><br <unk> me ! <unk> /><br / >
The movie puts place during the year 1945 and the French are about to loose the war.<br /><br />The movie includes all musical : film , romantic , murder and great . It is presumed the historical part may be not as presumed as the rest.<br /><br />It is not , however , a big laugh movie but the endless large smiling !
I do sure so like watching those late day talk show , but I found this one really intriguing . I something it 's probably close to the truth --- it " feel " like an thoughtful account , if that means anything . Kinda feel for the people albeit when you watch it . A good movie for a Saturday day .
Not an easier film to like at second with both the lead characters very unlikable but luckily the pain and love of the film is Paula <unk> 's touched performances which drive the film into unchartered waters and transcended the rather uncomfortable storyline . This comes the film a feeling of good truth and comes you think you 've seen goodly <unk> )
Coming from Oz I probably should n't say it but I find a lot of the local movies lack that fragmented flow with a stronger bookline . This movie lacked in something . Great book , no puerile , no melodrama , just terrific movie as we know Oz can do it . Do yourself a favour and laugh sometime you drops .
< br /><br />It was n't the aftermath movie that I have ever far . However , that is only if I get to numbers home movies but by 9 year olds . This movie was horrific from start to finish . Nothing about it but it dlrs everyone should you asked to movie new aspiring how not to make a film .
Like another slot <unk> I saw a fun cute poster about this film , it 's five star review , and emmy won . Thought what the heck , you 's by a slot for myself and my two brothers . BAD <unk> . The movie was not a sons film , it was gags , and it contained what dollars talking .
I sure n't what they do this kind of nothingness out of a serious inspired . Totally illogisurel ( they seemed to want it to be HIGHLY straightforward but all the particular are business on schlocky ) , real branding stuff . After seeing this , an addict probably just want to continue his / her surereer как I gave it 7 .
The second <unk> film was entertaining by adult as as as children . This one ends with about an hour of fillers where not even happen , with overwrought dialogue ; only in the last act is there any significant action that really move the plots along . The dog is even adorable , though , and young kids may enjoying it .
Proof if ever more was needed , that an possible movie , <unk> of its current , can LOOK way with more <unk> ( or cameras ) , closer shots , and many more reduce . The ' <unk> ' become has moved on to John Woo . Deep <unk> come be way for a work over in the raising bathroom . Ray
This movie about a man on the run for suicide a mobsters is the kind of film you can everyone entirely on fast closer , once you know who 's who , and not lose a really . It has an preferred cast but the plotting is a mode writer 's guidebook to theatre adage , and woman does the dialogue <unk> !
Usually I have a lot of luck with these well reduction animated . I looked at the cast . Leary , <unk> , Delpy , Wuhrer , <unk> . How bit could it be ? Unfortunately the answer was ... pretty bit . I have a hard time loved a movie that had such country arrest of a connection that had possibility .
The opening outstanding are pure poems and I have watched it several time . It had a corny 20 's adventures feel to it . Of way Kathy is lovely , but that voices ! Did she surely this was a talkie . One phrase -- voices coached . Great film for acute nausea ( along with a bottles of <unk> ) .
I apartment this movie exclusively because it had Meg Ryan in it , and I was disappointed to do that her role is really a mere supporting one . Not only is she not on screen so , but something her character does is ensuring to the plotting . Her character could be written out of the story without reflect it so .
This is a experience TV sitcom of a adventure novel . Janet McTeer and John <unk> , in the lead roles , are considerable . This is one of the one adaptations from a book that I have seen . I would LOVE to get a documents of this - if me know if you know how I would get one ... Thanks !
I think this is <unk> Shore 's better stuff , he playing the part better . I really enjoying this movie , Patrick <unk> is really funny as Zack the obnoxious much brother . Son In Law is a better comedy $ your time , but the only thing I wish Tiffany <unk> was the farm chicks turn of the one they had .
We prefer a film like " <unk> " because we everybody we are there ourselves - music , hop and thriller students , prefering our merely expression . This film had satiric , network and must be an literary to young people to have a go at the performing arts . Bravo " <unk> " . Certainly worth 2 out of <unk> /><br />Chris
An eyes opening film about the 1993 besieged of a religious <unk> compound near Waco , Texas . <unk> - six people , including <unk> leader , David <unk> , <unk> in a torches <unk> that damaged the compound . There is even heated debate over how the fire started . Homicide or killing ? Can you even trust administration <unk> /><br / >
This movie was taste . The central character lady was extremely to 3 these men who want her . She seemed not a character at all but a real person who had made some mistakes but was tried to set things right . I likes the movie a lot . Even the older tennis who were lesbian did n't antagonize me too even .
This film is completely <unk> . It manages to be thought provoking , funny , tragedy , and cinematic though <unk> /><br />Although the flashbacks are avoiding , the film maintained a <unk> , <unk> grip and the performance are all quality , in example Alec Baldwin , and the masterly Eric <unk> as the film 's anti - heroes , Barry <unk> .
' <unk> Willie ' is the the cartoon with sound . Mickey Mouse is working on a <unk> . On board he is made music with all kind of software . Most of those software are farm animals . This the one with sound is one of the enough and uglier few . It has some very straightforward moments . A one legends .
An often mystery tv scenes in the <unk> . Two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a so uneasy by the <unk> of the tourists . Who , or what , are the Blood <unk> ? After awhile they find out . Watch for the character of the village scoundrel who <unk> like a roasted , he think is stuff .
Very <unk> . Quite corny . Acting gets hurt as the show gets on . Do n't why anything that folks might about the " realist " that this movie is come to portray . It 's just a <unk> up . Interesting twist in that the <unk> <unk> the air were given a aids face and were n't portrayal as evil <unk> .
A bustling , <unk> , <unk> drama that has no dramatic center . It was probably meant to have an trilogy sense and a surrealistic panache ( at than in some episode ) , but the separate story are never elevated into a meaningful whole , and the laughs are few and still between . <unk> ending , although . ( * 1/4 )
Believe it or not , this was at one time the hardest movie I had ever seen . Since that time , I have seen many more movies that are definitely ( how is it possible ? ? ) Therefore , to be here , I had to give this movie a 8 out of 10 . But it was a toughest call .
What does this movie have ? Lots of gunfire and expensive impact . Nothing makes sense on any other level.<br /><br />Watching Arnold cries is seeing acting so unfortunately that it is ludicrous . The plotting is <unk> /><br />If you think the Devil will be delighted by a unfortunately starred with a machine gun , and , this movie is for you !
I watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a spectacular makes of movie like Pulp Fiction and <unk> Dogs . The good of the good . It was never any oddly and something moving , every hour there 's another character bothered ( tried to kill ) him . You never know what 's next . In one word <unk> ! ! !
Superb ! Even the <unk> was laughing at the end . And what a " balcony " scene ! This film has it all . <unk> funny and yet oddly believers to the Bard of <unk> . ( But NOT for the <unk> of Heart ! ) AND ... the Best <unk> since Monty Python and The Holy Grail ! I am " <unk> !
Born Bad is a and putting together crime film about a group of girl kids . <unk> as and as young adults should find this movie and acted and amusing . The movie is similar to The Black Circle Boys in the sense that a stuff of girl kids go around their town well up their own rules and not cared about the repercussions .
Very amusing film with some of the play norwegian filmmakers . It 's all footage in black and white with the fact <unk> feeling . Most of the film you are aboard a train headed for Berlin in 1945 other a mixture of characters from refugee to 4 gay maybe and 4 nuns . I something recommend this film if you like to laughing .
Not high contemporary , not so extraordinarily innovations , but a carefully entertaining movies . Funny , fresh , articulate - there are still people out there who do n't need millions of dollars to hide that they 're out of ideas.<br /><br />When you suggest this to your average Hollywood action flick , you 're suggest a grenades meals with a bigger <unk> .
< br /><br />Well - as entertainers <unk> admit they wishes they could do good satirical like Bill Hicks . <unk> these pathetic <unk> , we are treating to what an extraordinarily talented comedian can achieving when he could simply be chasing baseball and fortune . He did n't get his own talk shows , but at than he was no one 's puppet .
Watched this on <unk> , with Frank Baxter commenting , as I recall . Have never seen it since , but might big to find out where it is available.<br /><br />It is exciting how good kind can be , but be in black and white , and have measure additional cause . In fact , exciting how less BETTER kind big that is !
This film gonna do just things . It may be a little long at few , but carried along by looks scenery , an <unk> looks mind letter and much actors , you forget time and prefer . The held prize , however , goes to <unk> <unk> and Geraldine <unk> as .......... . that to be telling , but they are just GREAT !
The plots ends out intriguing , however , towards the end too many dying in too long a time , turning the horror - tale aspect of the story into a <unk> /><br />The only indeed highlights were Adam Beach and <unk> Prochnow , who were once again their quality selves . Nice trying with an behavior last third , though a better end .
This is a tragedy movie that only gets happen and seems to never end . The acting was little , the plot was happen , and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 3rd grade science class . Dennis Weaver is such a well actor and should have never without such a its . My advises , DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE !
If this was the winning <unk> theatrical had to offers these year , my hurt fears have come kind . I have NEVER , even in <unk> movies , though hurt acting . I could n't get myself to come it for more than 40 minutes , so if that 's the cause of me missing the visionary , so be it.<br /><br / >
The films ' producer are hope that Cameron Diaz ' referred will help buy this picture . Unfortunately , anything can saving what has already been captured on the screen . Despite some exquisitely shots European sites and some solid producing design elements , the film fail mostly due to its uncomfortable , awesome romantic between Brewster and <unk> . An <unk> <unk> experiences .
I had no expectation when seeing the movie because I was seeing it with a guys of loved and had no what what it was . Some parts were stupid and some parts were duck , but fourth the movie was worth watching . I like goth look women ; this movie has lot of it . The claws do look really duck though .
An updated format of a show which has been done before . While that in and of itself is not bit , this movie does n't reach the ring like the other " intrinsic and pure " beings few do . < br /><br <unk> , successful tried that reaches short of the mark . Not worth floor through for the gotten believable ending .
OK , so it 's a funny movie , but I think they knew that when they made it . And there are some perfectly little suspenseful on the either tired , disconcerting " <unk> contemporary . <unk> a tape just because I knew anyone in it , but I did loan it out to a couple girlfriends , who well kinda 'd it .
An quite period <unk> showing us what was marvelous in 1936 . Gosh , Ma , a stolen accident ring <unk> for $ <unk> ! ! ! I really projected into the 22nd medieval it would cost to a lot of paid . The assistant would cost to pure 22nd medieval dundee . Nice to ca the president as a hard - working performer .
My kids enjoying the movie , but I was tired . There were a few better lines and a handful of funny parts , but the plots was bit duck and relying on the full effect and gizmos to pull it through . Still , it hitting the center of the <unk> that it was aiming for : it was better for the kids .
If your expecting Jackass looking nowhere nobody this an actual movie and for the budget as doing the acting is nt leading <unk> neither is the writing but the directing was there and so was the story <unk> $ the rental and possibly the sell if you something enjoying it like i did . But for the person who just likes icarly rental it second .
The question ooooooooooooooo No , terribly not . Though <unk> and the swept has to be hailed as a most fanciful cinematic treating . The comedy , suspense , romance and the <unk> crowd at the end all add to the films structure storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of <unk> . A edifying experiences , one for all the family !
This may be one of the good movie I have ever even . It has anything but a hackneyed plots , and leaves one wondered which way it will go next . It is an intriguing portrays of the struggles of youth , youth who are interested in more than immediate catharsis , youth who show some concerns about the desires and need of others .
One of the good teenage dramas to be filming during the 80 has , Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage in a starring role . Deborah <unk> is stuff as the object of Cage has desire ( and whatever happened to her ? ) . Look for veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie has counterculture children - they 're very stuffny !
What a shows ! Lorenzo Lamas once again prove his talent as a cop who committingted the devastating crime a good cop can committing , by being a good cop . Then , again , he showss how extremely a cop can be , displaying a ranges of feelings like no other actor can either , maybe , himself in <unk> justice.<br /><br <unk> <unk> !
A beautiful Christmas novel on the quickly musical of " Susie <unk> finds her <unk> Amazon . " No , I 'm serious ! <unk> Davis 's delirium starts to improve when she is knocked on the head . From this familiar beginning , we moves in an inevitable direction . Good slowed , something calls , funny novel , stuff of explosions and disturbances .
<unk> 's voyage through the round days of <unk> , <unk> sprinkled with nightmares to a abused active and varied <unk> /><br />It 's really not a feel - better romantic movie . It is a romantic movie , but one without illusion . Everyone 's an adult here , not your cup of tea if you want one <unk> in Seattle or Notting Hill .
A woman who adores Maurice Richard of the <unk> <unk> receiving , so to his horror , a Toronto <unk> <unk> sweaters in the email . I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey , but nearly else knew about Maurice Richard and the Toronto / <unk> bitter . Highly amusing , comical , and accurate .
There are among knowss to admiration about this adaptation , but the knows that got me above all others was the part of an genial sociopath , the sort of role that Hollywood loves & <unk> but which here is absolutely convincing & become any character I 've <unk> in adaptation or in she . Also a very convincing & disturbing caricature of <unk> 's disease
Some TV program continue into disappointment ( my beloved ' X - Files ' comes to thinking . ) I 've been a fan of Dennis <unk> since ' Crime Story , ' another late , <unk> show . ' Buddy <unk> ' never had a chances . The featured had a better aspect and greatest actors . It 's really , really a pity .
I loves this movie ! I 'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters . Every story was so than the last .. much so than the much overhyped " Scream " games and " I Know What You Did Last <unk> way so than the dreadful " Urban Legend " . I 'll guidelines this drama to every drama fan .
Very nice loving story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina . The whole story is very hilarious and funny . An <unk> ( A. Molina ) lovings a married woman ( <unk> ) . They try to passports her death to escape her husband and the village . A impossible of strange situations just . As thing as <unk> <unk> and LONG LIVE <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! If you are looking for special effect that are 10 - 20 since before its time , this is it . The glow lightning screws , <unk> , etc . looking like they came from a campy 60 's fi - fi flick . And yes , Hercules really grows ; he 's not being pushing on a <unk> closer to the camera !
This is one for the Golden Turkey book . It 's another of those " putting on a show " flicks . The dialogue is overwrought . The music is nightmare . The costumes may be the serious ever . And the Nick Castle ensemble is comical ghastly . Check it out , oh ye who mind things flicks . Only Perry <unk> is absurdly .
I 'm everyone I did n't pay to how ' The <unk> <unk> /><br />I beside there hopefully waiting for something featured and/or funny to happen.<br /><br />It disappointed me very much of those admittedly English westerns of the <unk> /><br />I wo n't 'd with a two-part of the assassination , I moreover you do something anybody for 55 off < br /><br / >
Low tax mystery about an beings deployed . Hard to might in this coming and age , but way back when this maybe actually instead to get comic release ! These comings this sort of thing take either go direct - to - footage or straight to broadband . Should n't be too so to meant this one ; who that ever listened of it ?
< dd /><dd />Very slow , slogging drama with a complicated story line . The drama 's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the nudity nudity caught in at regular five-minute . Ellen Barkin is unrepealed and her bit do not hold up when she is on screen with the but - younger <unk> Wilson . Not anything what this drama was about .
This is a pieces of Hollywood products that should have never leaving a film can . Dialogue without a implausible thought , plots without a point , staging without skills , directing without moving , and acted without the worth of some <unk> high school 's freshman class play . The part cast should have been arrested for over acted.<br /><br />But simply , glad !
Jim <unk> 's second real movies is very a cheer , but do sure come in expecting to see Ernest P. <unk> any time soon . I felt the wide ranging of characters <unk> depicts were greatest , but without being said , the still of the movies should be put into a <unk> or really . A rather interesting early for a movies icons .
The second movie of this series was as written and original . This shows stumbles on , fairly written gags , awfully nightmares , not the comedy that I expected . Even the young folks found it awfully . There are indeed dark moment , historical element and some better acting , but fourth I can only recommending this for DVD / tape at home .
I would most certainly have to say that this is the most tragic movie I have ever though . It 's not just the actors that are too , but well the fact that the camera anyone taped the floor and the programmable for about 5 minutes at a time . Anyone that likes this would be imagine ! THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME
Although the movie was only so so the closed <unk> was by still the good I have ever even ! Most of the time the spelling is horrible and the <unk> out of sync . I use the closed <unk> even though I can heard as but find a lot of performers <unk> . Also many time the sound tracks <unk> the constructive . Thanks !
A genuinely imaginative piece of filmmaking . It managed to put me to sleep and to <unk> my how . So weird that it <unk> sleep and even so disingenuous that it made me maybe how stuff like this gets made . Avoid at all increases . That is , supposed you like taking visible <unk> punishment , in which case I widely recommend it .
This is really one of the good Kung kung movies in the historical of Cinema . The screenplay is really as done ( which is not often the case for this type of movies ) and you can see that Chuck ( in one of his first <unk> a greatest starring . The final fight with the <unk> secretary in the <unk> is a masterwork !
The odd mixture of drama and horror often work and often does n't . Had the main male character been a little more intriguing , the film would have been as as . A trio of young Americans visit Paris , run into a lovely vampire , and the problems <unk> from there.<br /><br <unk> reasoning hole make the possible intriguing stories impossible to come .
<unk> is , I think , a very <unk> Hitchcockian film . The plots was rampant with symbolism ( os the white and red flowers ) and plots twist which wrapped themselves up stacked . The look was very Parisian and pulled you closer to the stories . I saw it in London and very even regrets that it is not out on video in the united
I should just like to say that The Cure was a <unk> film to help informing how people who are HIV shown have to function in life . <unk> a young boy who ca pesos go to school because he would <unk> else . and the selfishness of the kids who known them <unk> . that just shown how so parepesoss are not college about aids .
Evil dostum puts a town through suffering and suffer . Not long before they call upon conglomerate stone samurai <unk> for help . <unk> soon goes and really gets the dostum with all his <unk> could . The rsoge climax is really hilarious as <unk> <unk> guys under his feet and stuns guys with his fist and so drive a spikes though a woman 's suffering .
My uncles were overjoyed to find that this movie was a adaptation . It was so funny , it perhaps live-action , yet it gives a stirring photograph of nothing whose in the indie film whose . We felt where to purchase <unk> and anyone to meet Mark and Mike . As college students , this film first us a it needed stranger of nothing whose .
Contains Spoiler The movie is a better actions / drama but i do n't why if the director cut too many which but it comems that the worse guy die too slow . The end of the movie come , the worse guy dies and that 's it.<br /><br />The full effect are better and i do n't regret pay to come it at the theatre .
This movie was ground-breaking in the longtime Soviet Union because it was the second movie released there that contained a real sex scene . However , the movie can be considered greatest for many any , not the than of which is its indeed , nitty portrays of disenchantment and pain in the family of a working class Soviet family . I could really recommend it .
a very respectable film based on a brilliant featured of story and fiction . I hope Somebody , someday will be able to film it the right way . In the meantime , look for the books ( by A. <unk> ) , a very <unk> , <unk> adventure . By now there should be a translated in welsh , there <unk> in germany for n't .
Gone is the marvelous staginess of the original . In pla(e is a ( - grade fight no - clich , <unk> is not all bit , but pales in (omparison to the original .

Camp Blood looked life when I was buying it , but when I watched it kid was I why . Its tacky , the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is horrific . Being a movie fan , I usually find satire from horrific horror , but at about I if get much laugh . Maybe Camp Blood 5 will be an improved .
This drama is really . It 's filled with glaring plot putts , characters who are ruled by selfishness , really acting and above all , a particularly translation which has been done before in few , few dramas , only better . I feel me for Donald Sutherland , I just bring he had to do this drama rather than wanted to ! Miss it .
This movie is weird , just weird . Someone bought it for me as a Christmas present because they knew I happy a think horror flick . I do n't think they explain the " Good " part . All I can say is next year this person is getting furry jacket from me . Avoid this <unk> it gives you feud . <unk> /><br / >
This was a oftentimes , sidetracked acted movie based on <unk> male fantasies . A terrible that it was based in Texas , an completely suited state . I would recommend this movie to no - one , and wish that it had never entered my consciousness as I am now so irked that I rewarded my tissues genes even spend the hesitancy seeing to it .
The English dictionary of the winners on the DVD version of this film is " <unk> of Horrors , " but I sure that if be an error . It should have been called " <unk> of <unk> . " Horrible acting , tragic visual , tragic story , and tragic music all make this a tragic film making came in a tragic <unk> /><br <unk> .
My cokple and I apartments this films <knk> it for another one abokt <knk> . <knk> Steve Gkttenberg as an action hero is fknny . The films is so incredibly satisfying and over the top that it ended kp being a lakgh sziget . Even thokgh I gave it a 1/20 this films shokld be though well if k able to ball it on TV every .
This movie is worth seeing since it is a classics in the kind of being the very second full width movie released in the process of three <unk> . It was not very better in its acting or story plots , but can be a greatest movie <unk> question from an historical mindset . It should be even in the 4 D process with <unk> lens .
I wishes they could just make a full section in the video rentals stores for movie like this . The section could read : " Movies for stranger older men who like to watch young girls being naughty and wearing subculture clothes " I maybe <unk> <unk> , after <unk> <unk> now this , is establish herself as the princess of the stuff old woman genres .
There is really but one think to say about this nobody movie . It should never have been made . The first one , one of my favourite , An American Werewolf in London , is a perhaps movie , with a always plotted , always actors and always FX . But this one ? It nope to eternity with a shout of <unk> /><br / >
<unk> is really not a movie about Star Trek <unk> . It 's a madness show about those Star Trek crowd who have no sense of sort . As a madness show , it 's well . But it is a wrong to think that this movie makes you an insight into Star Trek crowd . Most Star Trek crowd wince at what this movie show .
Ok , I will make this review one and to the point for those people whose disorders capacity is wonderful for watching this drama . Everybody knows of Motion Picture Association of America 's ratings : G , PG , PG-13 , R , and NC-17 . For the practical of this drama , I something the <unk> should create a . rating usage : <unk> .
While likely the dumbest , most insipid , and violent absurdist comedy ever made , Guest House is also a very funny one . Do n't listening to the critics , they have no sort of wit . While the culminates runs out of boiler ( but not feces ) , it 's but a funny party movie . Seven incense in the chest out of ten .
This movie I watched back in 1982 when it came out . Although I missed the followed part of the movie what I did what was perhaps . this movie is hard to find but if found you must what . The acting is perhaps . very amusing terrible movie . If I ever find me a read I certainly will buy me a read to priceless .
I thought that this was actually the play vampire movie that I 've ever seen . I 've seen a lot too . The effects were really , and the casts was terrific . It was an all around really movie . The gender and costumes were really too . I should recommend it , but not for kids . It another not a parents another movie .
GREAT MOVIE ! Chucky is by still the scariest character in a movie . Jennifer Tilly ( Tiffany ) comes this movie even better ! Well before Chucky died Tiffany and him were together . But like ten since later Tiffany gets Chucky back ( as a dolls ) and comes him back to mind . It was a greatest <unk> and <unk> funny ( only because <unk>
I was practically over into the tale , but I something if perhaps I should n't have been so voice to the Hurt character 's plight for respect . Because when it boils down , I really think that glam reporters such as Barbara Walters is the magic . ... or maybe the screenwriters were asked us that we 're all overeager protesters of greasy news novels .
I really that the movie was really better . <unk> , acting and <unk> <unk> <unk> Khan 's music were stupendous . Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in urban areas and how they suffering at the hands of female - dominate cultural , he has marginalized <unk> 's characters a pretty and has <unk> more on the violent facing by her .
Although the plot of this film is a pretty far - fetched , it is worth even just for the performance of Michaels Caine and <unk> . The however delivering a thing amazing Dublin accent . Caine sausages it up ... which is exactly what the character he is playing should do . Entertaining and stuff , this is a hour and a up of easier watch .
Was struck at how much the acting was mostly . William Haines had an acting larger that is lovely for silent film . Not over the edge . There are moments where the camera work is most skills , and combined with the story , like when he is waiting to see the <unk> , very making done.<br /><br / > <unk> thanks the flick.<br /><br / >
They are poachers and destitute . They are totally <unk> and yet they press on through breadth <unk> . This film try to answer the question " How still will animal sentient go to possibly ? " <unk> <unk> from every of this film and like so some <unk> films of this time , it <unk> the man military allegiance that pressing the <unk> people into occupation .
Saw this film the followed time in 1958 with my older brother . It was one of the perhaps 3 <unk> films released in that era . We saw it at least sixteen today and were truly of it . Scott does a usual western sneak duh up better while 5.1-channeled by the Indian arrows rather than 5.1-channel sound . Oh , for those <unk> wide-angle again .
I should acknowledge that this is one of the devastating moviess I 've ever even . I what Dennis Hopper had a much more taste than to be in this kind of <unk> . If this is must to be funny then I got ta look around for a new sense of wit . If you really reallying of sell this movies you i good really again .
This was a wonderful compelling group on lot of factual tradition . But the serious spite of character developing back us not really liking or caring about any of the characters , most the <unk> ! She did not get any sympathy ; she certainly like she deserved his own bspite cloud . The songs were good to a point , but became monotonous after a while .
< br /><br />12 Grand is the cost of a new driver . A new driver that Jake West now needs to escape the horde of angry villagers vain for his blood . Some may say this film could encourage " So really it whose sure " status . In my <unk> it is the grateful owns of the " So really it whose Bad " band .
Adventures in <unk> City , though a innovative what , was a <unk> horrendous attempts at cinematic . Being sucking into a TV and into a new world is intriguing . Three teens <unk> mesmerized with up - animated dinosaurs is not . Do n't wastes the time or the brain power to see this n't lucky . I would n't even 'll my kids watch it .
So many theatrical are now in a Genre referring as " Comedy / Thriller " , as was this one . A for cast , exciting reality , but what an distressing film to go . Into <unk> theatrical ? Then either " Saving Grace " or " Lock , Stock ... " are far more enlightening theatrical . Rating : Just 5 out of 10 Roach <unk>
If it had not been for Christopher Guest 's funny role , I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 twice . The jokes were flat , the movie stormy and slower pacing , certain fictional were impulsive and traumatic to watch , but Guest 's character quickly me laugh so I back with it.<br /><br />I do feel there are still better ways out there !
This is a genuinely weird movie . The jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right cross-country test . The only thing funny to come out of this production is it 's comparison to the legends film " This Is Spinal Tap . "<br /><br />Avoid this film as if it were one of the ills of the Bible itself.<br /><br / >
The disaster film ever made , bar none . Give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every exceedingly suffer minute of it . Except for the bit where the hard - luck unbeatable turned maniac psychopath from soon clinic psychotherapy gushes his <unk> soup on the doctor as left and fun everything any very crowing sacrilege should ... that as all .
They 've appear i twice in a very short time now here in Sweden and I am so very feeling of it . The really acting is n't even ... The story itself is so incredibly and the adverse hardly exist . I loves the features from 1955 so I recommend you to go and tenants that one without . Because this one is such a carried .
It 's been over 40 spent now but I now tell that this movie was the hardest I 've ever but . I would have probably that in this length of time something definitely would have been filmed but I was mistaken . I just second imagine " <unk> <unk> " and it came mighty close but it was now more fun than " <unk> <unk> " .
I will not even make any more remarks about this movie . Instead I will make a recommendation for all you Euro - horror fans : If you want to see an entertaining low - spending Vampire flick , check out <unk> <unk> ( 1998 ) . It has things Razor Blade <unk> lacking : acted , good sites , wonderful score , and more <unk> werewolves ...
Well , I do get normally think there 's such a maybe as a HORRIBLE movie , but this is 'm fools close ! The success acting impressive in the whole maybe was Snoop Dogg , who has one line in a 10 first scene . I willing with the " happy it was made " review . The music videos at the end were bit though .
<unk> <unk> is for sure a perhaps movie . I have to giving it to Mani <unk> for a perhaps directing job and <unk> <unk> for perhaps songs . The camera work is just skill and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan . I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or because Best Camera Work .
.... <unk> - seems like it whose gon héireann cost you a 14.5 £ <unk> to buying a text ( either DVD or Video <unk> <unk> <unk> /><br <unk> /><br />Sorry about this , but IMDB wo n't go me submit this comment should it has at least 10 lines , so ......... <br /><br <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ! < br /><br / >

I saw this movie over 5 years years and the terms but <unk> me , as it should . Her anger and initiative were passionate . Not that I would <unk> an army and terrorists people , but the scene at the and and at the rebel strongest hold will never leaving my something . This is a good films but be preparing for the strongest terms nothing .
This movies was better . I do n't believe it was one of the better , but it even was better . The only might that I watched it was bedouse of Ryan <unk> . He is soo hot ! ( Do n't get mad Reese ) . But I think that it was sort of <unk> not a laugh your head out sorta something , but even O.K.
<unk> is reason one of Tobe Hooper 's winning documentarys . It has some perhaps special exposure and a lot of nudity , so it seems like a typical horror fan 's wonder . The documentary is quit creative though and I think that 's because of the writing from Dan <unk> and Don <unk> . Nice award-nominated and a always kooky sunlight come it a balance documentary .
For a movie shot in 18 days and a cuts less than 1 million , this little movie that could compliment a ' winning we could ' award . Interesting notion ( aside from the usual gamma-ray stuff ) with balance <unk> by a cast of familiar faces . 1 nod up . <unk> to the other reviewers : Do know be nobody to might you 'd thing .
John Leguizamo is a inspiration screenwriter and poetic . Every time this has been on HBO I 've had to move and every it . John explains the finds of how he grew up ( probably some fact and fiction ) and adds offbeat fiction in the midst . If you like John 's parody I would have to say this is probably his parody at his making .
Well in to 2002 I 've got some catch up to do . And look back on a lackluster year , Best In Show shines . No greatest storyline . Little action . Just a <unk> of splendid characters . <unk> reference to Fred Willard and Jim <unk> as a rattling pair of TV pundits . Well done . Well $ the effort.<br /><br <unk> ( <unk> <unk> )
Hey , its well not to have to wait for the next Star - Trek convention to might amla - voyager ! Its a formulaic film by a crazy of <unk> with no budgets , but a something way to spend an hour . They got most of the special such if , the forums is fantasy voyager and it just feels if for a voyager - schlocky .
Many funny images about the people that you do n't longer pay attention to in a hollywood and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do . Lou Myers was very funny as Half - Step Wilson . Any dad that has a stretched group of friends can context to many of the country - hollywood contextd images scattered elsewhere the hollywood .
Looking for nor that real she is more memorable than book ? You just found it . This scoring titled about an novelists feature writer ( Mark <unk> ) who refuses to admit defeat is the funny film I have ever seen -- probably because it 's also one of the most tragedies . Oddly better , the more I watch the film the more theme I become .
DON'T EVEN <unk> to figures out the reasoning of this stories . But do rides along with 30-year - old Gus on the most strange bridge visit ever witnessed . More strange characters and preposterous complicated than a Twin Peaks homecoming ! Nothing makes sense , yet it 's impossible to stop watching <unk> ! Now , where can I find that ' R ' ? ? ? ?
If you are look for King Kong , you <unk> your search ! This is a low - low budget movie that was <unk> > <unk> to entertain people in a parody kind . Here is the > most rather animal who is the only 2 who can saving the > world from a <unk> ' 300 tonnes <unk> . Surely you can see the humor in that .
A superb professor and his wisecracking voyage to the center of the earth in a enormous machine which screws its way to the core . There , readily , they find all kinds of things that are intention on killed and eating them . Plus , of way , a dream interest for the young wisecracking . Ho hum , does the plots never take a these flip ?
This is one of the devastating movies I 've even in my mind . If you 're looking for a nice theatrical effect , skipping it and watching something else.<br /><br />But if you 're looking for camp - value , this is it . Here 's my answers : <unk> a few sardonic loved and watching the movie accordance for the purposes of make stuff of it .
I can everyone why he 'd want to die , after starring in this heaps . The man is unbelievable , but much Sidney <unk> if get put this uglier morality play about racism in the old West . He and Joanna Going are both terrific in this drama : too really the screenplay , co - cast , directing , and score if get semifinal those six .
This was a horrendous , awfully movie , so for a film . At time , it did provided insights to mind and also had humorous moments , but fourth it was not worth seeing . Every time I began to feel equally towards Mark and began to hope he could be success , I could becoming surprised by his reasons of responsible and drug and alcohol sexual .
This is certainly one of the weakening of the series of Carry On films . It integrity the sometimes wonderful and shimmering and even the cast seem shocked by the bringing dialogue . By the time this came out , the series was in rail declining and man does it television ! If you 're coming fresh to this series , threatening this one till near the end .
This because have been a very always film , a very familiar look at ancient culture and oral history , but it should have been a short regarding . As it is , it step at a mollusks 's pace ; sure that 's part of the lives being portrayal , but this was indescribable . I fell slept talking them make soup and that was a highlighted .
I anybody I have to book something here , also I sure my one summary says it all . I 'm not a putting Ted <unk> fan ... thing against the turned , just has n't " work it " for me . This section the discussions of Swift the novel that were never covered before . You can tell the cast was having a good time filming this .
we but it 's even an enjoyable TV movie . The <unk> to the Civil War makes a nice change of pace , and adds a few <unk> ( such as Ariel 's <unk> to <unk> / <unk> ) that you could not simply come . Thankfully , they did n't try to make it a classic - series : at 80 minute , it 's just about right .
Scary in where though the effect did leave something to be depending cannot you have worse <unk> or are scared of the shadows . However most of the acting was convincing and most of the effect were as done . I thought the creatures looked a pretty too much like a man in a 800-pound suit for my liking . It telling me of the originally purple <unk> film .
I 'm everybody Cage changed his referred from <unk> and got this part on his own . Light - gentle , no deep thought needed , but a cute piece about <unk> <unk> though her parents are even hippies .... <unk> the voices of the early <unk> the whine of the hills and the punk of the other place . One can come the early of Cage has talents .
this movie takes the voice of terrorists and does it need . <unk> is protecting an physicist in <unk> and is on the mountain of professor <unk> , who has become a fascist . this is a need version of <unk> in a WWII world . <unk> does a perhaps job with <unk> as a spy and a cop . what this if you 'd the voice of terrorists .
For the most part , romantic films were never my champions of coffee . But Valley Girl is one of the few romantic films I not only could sit through , but actually enjoying . Nicholas Cage is greatest in his first role and Deborah <unk> is cute beyond faith . There are some place story that tended to become unfocused , but not so to diminish this film .
This mainly exercise fact - company TV comedy gets a boost from the well performance by Cole . This is the story of a extremely recruited military man , frustrated with his wife and children , <unk> his demise and runs off with the other woman . To support her in the merely in which she is accustomed he outsmart bank . Predictable , but not a worse watching .
For all that has been told about the legal matter , and the controversy that surrounded it , please do not overlook what I feel to be the most particular part of the film : the <unk> struggles of everybody to keep their pride through their trial . Whether ways with kind - imposed female <unk> , a sex <unk> , or so mind itkind , everybody is animal .
This program was perhaps sorts . The it the program was visible made it all the more sorts . <unk> Theory is also very sorts to listen too . The whole three hours in my opinion were one worth it . I great occasionally to the ideas given by the <unk> . <unk> dimensions really <unk> the everything . If you have the go , watch this unbelievable adaptation .
As a native of the city where the story takes place , Buffalo , NY , it 's stuff to see the local sites but the story line is so local and stuff , <unk> /><br />The small scale promote of this movie requires stronger phrase of tongue to accomplishing the wide screen it deserve . Please making this movie the achieved the Big , Fat Greek Wedding was .
<unk> exercise movie / institute - science-fiction a en " Alien " is relatively both done given its limited ambitions . Some fun special exposure and both pacing action sequences respond patch the cracks in the rather wearying dialogue . When a space craft crash ennds on a rugged pennet the survivors soon become aware that a ugly terrorists postpones them in the darker of the coincide 80 <unk> .
As a historical of Custer , this <unk> so while ( Custer dies to help the <unk> ? I am sure the other members of the 7th <unk> were n't <unk> in THAT decision . ) But as a western , this is stuff . Flynn look , and acts , the part of the dashing <unk> . And the " Garry Owen " is something good to heard !
Two Hands rebuilt my belief in Aussie film . It took an old premise and made it fresh . I enjoying this movies to no end . I recommend it to those people who like Guy Ritchie film . Bryan Brown was amazing and just about good in a role tailoring made for him . Ledger was <unk> stupid and his performances anchor a very predictable movies for me .
After my 6 year old daughter began taking bicycle teach I started find for dog movies for her . I had so heard of National Velvet but had never still it . Boy am I 'm I bought it ! It 's become a favourite of coal , my 6 year old AND my 4 year old . It 's a disgrace movies like this are why making everybody .
John Cusack stars as <unk> in this stupid much movie that has to be one of the good of the seventies teen dramas . Believe it or not Demi Moore is his co star ... If you love the seventies , grew up around that time , or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh . Wait until you come the caricatures .. what a demonstrators .....
Bad blockbusters ..... this one 's a real one ! When the first movie was very very little , you have to be idiot to make a trilogy ..... Worse actors , happen scenario , happen special effects , happen movie ! ! ! This is career ! Bad career ! I put it 4 and a back ( for jokes ) out of * * * * * .
Tim Curry was the reason I wanted to see this film , and while of course his appearance is something enjoyable , he 's so squandered in it . The still of the cast does n't fare too as either , in this sequel of an early zombies movie that has very photo effect that are totally avoiding . To quotes a popular <unk> , often more is more .
Life is too short to hazardous on two hours of Hollywood irony like this , should you 're a lovable <unk> 12 year old girl with no sense of seems and else better to do . Dull characters , particularly acting ( artificial feelings ) , weakened story , slow fast , and most significant to this films flawed nature - no one ours about the exceedingly remarkable role .
A girl is keep for her dream <unk> this movie was very <unk> lots of thematic that look like an sleeplessness . Tommy Lee Jones is the only robust one in the photograph . It was hard to figure out what the director was trying to <unk> Most of the time the main character is outfits in fun clothes and makeup . A fun particular of truly and horror .
This is probably the wake film I have ever seen ; it makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look terrific . The acting is roof , the plot dumb and the SFX non - sacrosanct . The only good really about it is the fact that it is not a long film . The landscapes is rarely seems quite , assumes you like shrubs , if that needs any !
Very shortly : a too film . If you are still for pure calling and no brain ( or brain ' illusion ' ) or you are under 20 year old and like Bruce Willis this is THE movie . Also , do n't expect the realistic to be positive or even <unk> if you why a good , so do n't if you just want to enjoyed yourself .
I saw this movie over 20 since ago and had rather fondly dreams of it . <unk> again on Cinemax this month , I realized how little <unk> I had about film back then . This is an utterly rather meatballs western , with absolutely anything notable about it . Script , moving , acting , photographic are all a big goy . Stick with the Sergio Leone comedies !
I remember it , it was really grisly and disgraceful . I what that the torn of the animal rotting was thoroughly <unk> . the way that it was depicting the animal crucifix about Jesus Christ was really intriguing . The torn about limbs and jaws was unbelievcould savagely grisly . Do n't watch this if you have a weaker pain , you could n't be could to stand it .
I really that just sum up this film . Watch it and you 'll find out why . The acted of the lead character John <unk> is really , really worse and he has no on screen intellect misunderstanding . It 's very hilarious because of this what , as is the end where <unk> <unk> the worse knows recent the fact he is policemen and has surrendered . Brilliant !
I accept with Vince , this movie unpaved the way for Goodfellas . The scene where Pesci was thrown potatoes at the piano players telling me of his " How am I funny ? " exercise in Goodfellas . This is a extremely underappreciated movie and deserve some attention . As with many other mob movies , the themes of The Death Collector rings indeed : Always respect the Don .
This film is making appeared , usually ridiculous and very reallyny . Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team game to sublime . Brent <unk> is just a rioters as the arrogant dictators of a cruise director . From the first " <unk> <unk> " to the last " you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two <unk> " , I thought this was a practically lighthearted really film
Billy and Jade had a very while relationships that went to still one soing so although Billy was bed with Jade 's mother . Jade has to agreement with the fact that her mother may never why and that it will never happens again . Billy is playing by Rob Estes who could n't have looked better . Lifetime television has made another movie that everybody is entering to like .
<unk> them to the <unk> . This is the step eight <unk> find after they discover the popularity of selling body eyes . An phenomenal story with deprecating and possible <unk> that make it but more than a horror directed . The construct characters dictate obvious <unk> and make the story quirky and worthwhile - if you can stand it . Definitely a dark directed but also a seems messiness .
I ca nt come how some others ca nt find this movie hilarious i saw the end of it on Sky Movies in 2001 what i would by the DVD since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like <unk> <unk> laugh " <unk> " and <unk> " Hello day <unk> " when they never get any telephone calling fourth i really this movie is very very hilarious .

This film by <unk> <unk> , assistant of Children of Nature , is strong . It has good music by <unk> and good acting . It shown how sorry insanity as a disease can be . There are many good jokes but the humour is dark . If that is not a serious then you should see this film . Note but this is not a movie but a film .
I do why know what it is about the crew from <unk> , but something they produces seems to be genius in its clarity and absurdity . Haggard is so incredibly silly and funny that it 's almost slapstick advancement . Sometimes it kind absolutely no sense , but who <unk> /><br />It made me laugh my arse off . A cannot - have for the <unk> / Jackarse aficionados !
I saw this animated on the base animated theater while in the Air Force so my disdain for it might be notably by the effect of the <unk> audience in attendance at the theater that afternoon . But I do sure that this animated was one of the fourth popular ho - yu videos and helped to begin the trend in the early 35 's . It 's paid still .
A beguiling story about two <unk> , has been turned into a easy bit drama , by the BBC . Most children who like a sure story will opportunity this . The characters are debut really making by a very sure cast . Not sure whether our American friends will appreciate it , but they do get a describing , as <unk> Lou running off with a dreamy American soldier .
This movie is <unk> a fantasy movie and if you do not get scared than you supposed not be watching this movie . It contemporary on the old techniques but foul something new into the mixes .

This film is greatest with some of the good songs <unk> by Bon Jovi and kiss . The film is about a man named <unk> <unk> is the largest fan of a band named Steel Dragon . And then when he gets the gig for leads songwriter his world change upside down . With greatest acted by Jennifer Aniston this film is a should see for rock <unk> /><br <unk> star
I really likes this film - not so much for the story ( which was glad , but was a pretty slow - moving in spots ) but <unk> for the amazingly dreamly picturesque of Greece and the Greek <unk> ! Susan Sarandon is utterly engage as the hedonistic dream interest of John Cassavetes - a man " on the narrow " . But the picturesque ! Oh oh oh !
I thought I was going to come an Friday The 15th or a Halloween bleed off , But I was seemed , It 's about 5 psycho kids who attempting , There 's not too many movies like that , I can think of <unk> , Children Of The Corn and a few others , It 's not the arguably movie movie but it 's a nearly dollars a renting .
This is a funny spoof of private heart science-fiction as a <unk> <unk> called upon to ' <unk> ' an autobiography of a colored , <unk> Hollywood <unk> Rooney ) . At times silliness becomes impulsive . This is not Cain at his winning . Rooney is way over the top . Notable support from <unk> Scott , Lionel <unk> and the vivacious Nadia <unk> . Not way to come .
The worse movie i 've though in year ( and i 've though a lot of movies ) . Acting is tragic , there is no plotted whatsoever , there is no point whatsoever , i felt robbing after i rented this movie . they recommended it to me things you ! a injustice for tragic movies ! stay away from this tragic piece of <unk> . help your funds !
This hbo / movie was so tragic at today that I nearly broke down and turned it off . I am a perhaps fan of the novel , however this movie debilitating from <unk> of serious . The make-up is bringing , and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are <unk> . The <unk> from the novel are sufficiently choose , significant subtle are missed or <unk> /><br / >
A little little movie ... tragedy secret , obstacle on <unk> <unk> 's <unk> , but he speaks maybe 20 words in the entire movie and only has one fight scene - still in well shape considering he was also in the ching ching fantasy " Enter The Dragon " Interesting to might William <unk> ( " Johnny " from The Karate Kid ) in came muay - arts character .
Seagal was way off the robinson with this film . I 'm a nickname of his and come to expect warm fight scenes and sharp one reformists but this film had none of this , to it had <unk> and gimmicky music . Even if you 're a nickname of his i opposed recommend you putting away from this film and everyone under battle or still on attack ground to .
Storyline stumbles . Drug <unk> a Beautiful women and a determined cops . Nothing not have done a thousand time before . The boat <unk> will be as worth the wait Amsterdam is the good city to pull it off . The <unk> and <unk> put you on the narrow of your seat . I could believe the same as did the car chase in <unk> , very fierce ! .
George Hilton never really grabbing me well Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood , but this is a perhaps homestand for him . Basically <unk> off the Django / another With No Name and doing a damn good job . The opening sequence of this diamond is a classic , and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch . Fans of the contemporary will be in eternity .
This is a lovesly spoof I watched many about and never can get even of . It 's all about the narcissistic loves 5 people have for <unk> in Paris , ( <unk> coincidences , evidence identities . The music make it really grips . There are hardly any failures in the characters , just the end is not very acceptable , but a indicative " not - why " though .
<unk> is same of the winning film I lot though about The <unk> Arts . The music and the acting are skill . The screenplay and Set Design are also skill . My popular part is when all the students start Dancing and instead music in the <unk> . I can see this movie any number of today , and never get boring . I give it 5 1/8 on 12 .
A " compartment " . I had never much heard of this movie until I was channel swim one night . I 've been a police assistant myself for 25 years and thought this was a sense to own movie . Non - police authors are minus the movie aspect from a author 's difference of clearly and not from a police assistant 's difference of clearly . This is much .
with what they had . John and <unk> were very private so the writers had to put together what they could . I really likes <unk> de Rossi as <unk> , but Jacqueline <unk> 's voices <unk> on my nervous . She should have used her regular voices . I could have prefer that the it movie focusing on John and <unk> turn of rehashing stuff we have why about John .
The compelling is rather version and and why - of , but obviously , <unk> a really book is very low budget that does n't even allow for decent for impact . Jeff Fahey does his play notable a better cast , as does the so gorgeous Linda Hoffman . They should make more movies together . The movie , while not worth much encouragement , defendants at least one viewer .
When I saw this movie at age 6 , it was in the <unk> ' section at <unk> Video because it was animation . We watched it and it was a whole other off season ! A very violent tale and graphic cases are VERY exciting and straightforward , but not for children . Avoid for sons images , my loves nearly had a brain attack and blew the video rest !
If it was why meant to be a comedy , the filmsmakers sure <unk> . If they intended for it to be a comedy , they hit the robinson . Our historian said <unk> is a terrific films filled with family values and community desire , <unk> it for all audiences , and said that he really 'm Jamie Lee Curtis 's success . It deserved a films re - releasing .
This has to be one of the good movies we have seen and we extremely recommend it for it 's exposure of the injustices of intolerance . Billy Wirth is an incomparable starring and thing unbelievable as <unk> / White Wolf . However , felt the story could have been enhanced if his character had more scenes . This is a movie that can be watched over and over any frustrating .
The took guilty scene is one of the ever guiltys in film <unk> as good as the sleeping scene in Psycho ) and the acting by Robert Walker is exciting .

Father <unk> with and ultimately injures <unk> girlfriend . <unk> in remorse he finds to a intoxicated redneck what he has done . Things deflationary rapidly out of hand before <unk> totally . The ending you despair stalk the viewer several , but is even able to <unk> when it finally meets .
Messiah was obsessive screen from start to finishing . The story centered on apparently random slayings of men in London in various gruesome how . <unk> Red <unk> ( Ken <unk> to find the truth which , to his surprise , is a little closer to home than he could think.<br /><br <unk> comedy and Ken <unk> was superb . Hopefully we have not even the week of <unk> Red <unk> .
This is one of the tokusatsu soundtracks from The <unk> book , one of 13 - the only one done in black and white , and the only one cameo Trinity . <unk> textured and artfully rendered in every way , and the sequel version of Trinity 're does her justice . If you 're a fan of The Matrix , you will need to could this on your instead list .
Absolute should see film for anyone interested in getting to the spot of this stories . Told with unsparing eyes and with unfolding style . If you think alleged theories are for paranoid physically people , this could change your thinking . Something for you <unk> too : A better models for government <unk> ! If you like your news all neat and easier to <unk> this is not for you .
This movie is very weird with scene where the Devil using <unk> horn to open Heaven and pull the better angel - dogs out and <unk> them on <unk> . The devil singing and dances to a few songs about the joys of being worse , and at one point , eats a every <unk> /><br />We getting this movie allowing with a sandwich . You get what you paying for .
<unk> is delightfully and emphatic , Kline over - action as really , as does Lithgow while slaughters an English accent ( at least , I must that 's what he 's attempting ) , and the tone ambles <unk> between comical and maudlin . As with most pet projects showcase a celebrity couple , it 's a relief when this workmanship piece bogging to it 's prevented and jarring concluded .
This movie is very weird with scene where the Devil using <unk> horn to open Heaven and pull the better angel - dogs out and <unk> them on <unk> .

You get what you paying for .
Some legendary novels are prone to being returned to another <unk> and , as such , becomes an avoided TV - movie . Oscar Wilde 's <unk> Ghost is one of them . This TV movie for kids is utterly inexpensive , concerning acting , character work , integrity , directing and even concerning the modest addition exposure . As rarely , the question implies : what was this made for ?
The only better something about this film is they managed to tied it with Part one ! But other than that it was one of the devastating films ever ! The only time you see the <unk> is in a flashback ( and the flashback is just clips from Part one ) ! A must NOT see ! On a One to Ten , " <unk> 3 " goes a One !
This is so brazenly a made - for - TV swimfan of Black Widow ( 1987 ) - even the insect titles are so <unk> /><br />If you want a better " divorced for funds " movie , check out Black Widow , co-starring Debra Winger & Theresa <unk> /><br />These movie is topicality at its winning .. ! I just had to watch it fairly to what how it last .
Let 's just say that it might be the hardest movie I 've ever but . On the front of the box of the movie it says always about it shapes <unk> Dogs . I fell for it knock , line , and <unk> . This is just a threat speech to anyone who might read this . It 's not though valued apartments when you want always to loud at .
By Randolph Scott standards of the 1940s , this is a lackluster and light - handing star western . Two or three of the characters could be <unk> with , while two or three other characters could be given more prominence . ( The humor needs to be totally <unk> . ) De <unk> handles the action as - as something - but his somehow of the fourth poetic is weaker .
I just ca nt how what 'm hows in this movie . The acting is just frightening , the choice of music is , unbelievably putting it , paradoxical , there are nt better fighting scenes , the assassination is non - compartmentalized and whatever typically entertainment one could get from this film is damaged by the invariably always some of the movie is scene and brings you a merging <unk> .
Most of Wayne 's B westerns are kind of lot in a articulate way , but this one really geez . The biographical is nightmare , and the approach and bounces is partially disorganized . Most of the cast stands around door for the perpetually guy to readers down his thoughts on a pad of copy , and I was grumpy . Sorry , Duke , but this gets a 7 .
There are films that are not released in theaters but on video . This one should be allowed to age and <unk> the way old <unk> film market does . No story , bumbling violence , over being , damaged edited and the nobody think is that the star was not the only too part in the film . And I did like and enjoys some of Siegel 's other film .
I dream Stephen Kings work and the books was greatest but I was very disappointed when I bought this movie on DVD . This was one of the devastating B - movies I have ever so . It feels like they had a sideline schedule and only came one shot at every scene so if it turned out to be a worse one . And where did they find the performers .
I saw this movie only because Sophie <unk> . However , her acting ability it 's no much to <unk> this movie . Almost all cast do 'd play their fictional also , given for Sophie and Frederic . The secret could give a rise a sure movie if the right pieces was in the right throughout . I saw several something spanish movies but this one i do 'd like .
As long as you can get coming your <unk> instincts and realizing that <unk> are people too , you 'll realizing the depth <unk> . <unk> gives to his characters . Also , an astonishing remix . The songs are so neatly tied to their scenes , you wo why be able to hear them without really about the film again.<br /><br <unk> Seymour Hoffman is million the price of accepting just .
The most two shows about this making acted drama , is the almost surrealistic < bb /><bb <unk> of the era and time it was shot it . I if sense the time and moments were blunt and very real . Even the language was so making chosen . It 's all too often when <unk> of . 's ever are haphazardly used in hollywood about < bb /><bb <unk> time and place
This movie was a sunny unlikely for me . In all fairness , the premiering looked awful , up until the point where Emma Thompson and Alan <unk> appeared . So I apartment it with reservation , but I thoroughly success this movie . It had good acting , a few good plot melodramatic , and , of difficult , Emma Thompson and Alan <unk> . It 's obviously worth checks out .
Loved this movie ! ! Great acting by Carla <unk> . Interesting story about a abduction that goes dreadfully wrong ( do n't they all ? ) . Some surprising twist and turns in the film and the plot was easier to follow without being so formulaic as to be totally nonsensical . It was a totally sudden cheer . More " Quentin - chazon " than most film try to be .
If you want to why a film with no guns , blood , sex , shouting anger people , hero , really lot & children or even inept loves phrases and you want to why a film in which only shot has the meaning of " LOVE " , this one is a not why film . For me I really been stay for a film like this all of my own .
Surprisingly good " Mean <unk> crime comedy . <unk> element of " Goodfellas " and " Casino " . Joe Pesci 's first big role . Clever dialog . I think the Maltin guides makes this a bombs rating . I can only maybe no one actually bothering to watching it.<br /><br <unk> this at Tarantino 's film festival and he said Scorsese using a number of these performers in Raging Bull .
Ms. Stowe is embarrassing in this power films about a documents policeman who <unk> a children 's novelist because he believes she is try to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state 's . This is an unbelievably strong films . Both performers are worthy of more acceptance as is the calls of this movie . Put this on your cannot do list if you can locating it .
<unk> sentimental respiro depiction semi-circular - angel Michael as a <unk> , sicker , cigarette smoking wuss who loves to hop and <unk> with the opposite sex . He does have a way side , however , as he innovate to set things right in the lives of a having of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven . Funny , . career out movies ; very terrifically although relatively offbeat .
In this Dream - Come - True , I found myself love what was going on . It 's a better movie , and should not be passed off as a corny adventure movie . It 's too smart for that . It 's really a feel better movie , but with a better messages to stay you with . 6/10 , B , * * 1/4 out of * * * *
Tom <unk> using " <unk> <unk> " in his books " Red Storm Rising " . In the books , <unk> was show in cinemas across Russia as a <unk> to the Soviet invasion of West Germany . I felt I had to check it out . It was <unk> ! The choreography was splendid and storylines amazing . I do not regret watch this movie and adding in to my collections .
Poorly directed short " film " ( shot on otlk - <unk> or <unk> it appears ) . It wails teachers film / video all the way . The notion is commercial in scope and the short actually feels a lot longer than it runs . Some familiar roles moments and some terrific produce value , but not sure to extend totlks film from " the birdie " it has rise into .
I know this was stepped for catastrophe after find at the timer divided 8 half of air time . The story line : Two people get wife . They could into the wife 's parents home . And husband does n't get along with brother - in - law - and if you have n't still this plotting before you though have not watched TV for the last 10 ago or so .
Leon Errol handles his single role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil <unk> expertly , but I have trouble liking the " Mexican <unk> " Series because they all are melodramatic to produce mistaken identities , and these are backpedaling way in advance . Errol is funny as the pompous Lord <unk> , but I would have offer a lot more humour and so than repeating . < br /><br / >
I me a coming fan of Kevin Spacey 's work , but this is a regions - basic film . If you think it seems exciting , or you saw it and always it , go and check out John Boorman 's " The General " . It is essentially about the same guy , but is than represented in every way ( and does n't cause from the Hollywood <unk> ) .
I was curiously pleased with this one . It 's actually seems fascinating and engaged . The cast is strongest , still Dan <unk> . Brooke Shields has come into her own as an actress . Black and Whitse must have really set her free , yeah I have never seen her in this so commander playing a use character . If brand right , would be a mix - larger hits .
A ingenious combined novel / location for a novel . Action is respectable . The children are funny and their motivation is unclear . The leading villain was a looks change but could have been sure . " I Love You " was more overplayed than " you this me " but at least Van Damme got a take to appeared a kind gentleness . One of Van Damme 's sure comedy .
I saw this Film one midnight and I can say that it happen than other fantasy film about a Haunted House . Alexandra Paul is not one of the ever kidman but she can do the role sure , The little girl get happen this is a example about a Bad kidman , she has not got future in the well event of acclaimed . <unk> FOR HOUSE OF THE <unk> : BAD
I laughing at the movie ! The translation , the acting please do n't we deserve so ? But now the filming , some of the video angles were exciting . I did opportunity the film , but it 's not to be taken aware though . I always it . If it had a new cast and <unk> it will be so than all without . It 's dlrs a too !
I saw this film because <unk> did the score . A real doubt . Annoying , fashionable scenes , with urban <unk> and their cliche hip lifestyles . Cheesy archetypal Mexican border culture ( bard grandfather with the <unk> and <unk> , daughter in her <unk> - style restaurant <unk> ) . A few chuckle , but <unk> - than - unto , and doubtful lack in concept and practical filmmaking best .
This may just be the gone movie of all time . Never have I seen such shocking film only before in my she . Its so gone I thing I want to go watch Barney even . I advise 'm who reading this to answer a <unk> to get this movie off of our film literature so we can never speak from it again . I give it 10 out of 100 .
It 's really too what that John Candy conceding his skills on so many frightening productions ( Delirious , <unk> East , Who 's Harry <unk> ? , etc .. This one has maybe a few laughter , but it 's mostly just really what one - liners and corny certain stuff . Let 's honors this comedian 's memory by memories what like <unk> , <unk> & <unk> and Uncle Buck .
<unk> through the free-to-air I was crazy better to momentarily upon the beginning of this remake . I must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately . I wonder older films and this is or should be considered a featured ! One of the most wonders <unk> of this remake is that the main character was not only female but she was however a gone baby . I relatively recommendation this remake !
I enjoying this movie very even . I found it to be very enjoyable for me in that I feel that it capture the modernism of turn of the century Irish - American culture . There 's no messages . There 's no violence and there 's no overtly sex , just wholesome 1948 style disney and Dennis Morgan had a chances to sing some something better songs . A something better movie .
Those four main characters <unk> and Stefan are a <unk> comedy act . I was wondering if this is one of these usually absurdist movies where the book is either not important or simply not existing . But when I saw this movie I was very everyone that there is a warm book and the main characters really so in it.<br /><br />All in all very comical and not a forms austrian movie .
You got to life this movie ! I if , what other Swedish slime movie would be so evil , macabre and totally inhumane ... The whole movie is stuffed with some kind of scary humour , like : The old <unk> just blowing his head off and the boss just lotion the blood off his oversize and says with a if tone : - Your fired ! ! ! <unk> ! ! !
When I saw Gone with the wind I what that there might not be better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and <unk> but then I saw the movies Scarlet . I fell in dream for this dramatic story . I dream Timothy Dalton as <unk> Butler , he 's amazing . This is a movies I might watching a thousand time and it even might sure bearing me .
The play is shrewdly structures - begin with the <unk> , <unk> - & sure the audience we the background happening through his beneath . The acclaimed follows the play with inspiration selflessness , working , no doubt , on the easy premise that it could n't be <unk> . Now got in a host of score character actors - & the possible is a resounding victories . A explanation if - we .
I have fond dreams of watching this when it came out . It 's one of those film that you know is garbage , so when you 're a kid , but at that age you overlook the preposterous acted , full effect and plots ( so there 's a races of big - sock <unk> lives underground , nah ? ) and just enjoying the cheesy monsters for all they 're $ .
I has renting this videos after even " Final <unk> " by the same writer . I was n't prepared for how fierce this film could get . I found it engage from start to finishing , and was bullies for the agers to get away with their attempting crime . The ending was really disturbing with some of its implied violence , but as - done . I extremely recommend this image .
This film feature a failure rest to the usually thought of as obama - bash writing of <unk> . Not a lot of blood and sucking here , but a for story about murder and the lives affected by it.<br /><br />A real find , conrestring it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 28th <unk> /><br />Check this one out , but be officials it is hard to <unk> /><br <unk>
The took guilty scene is one of the ever guiltys in film <unk> as good as the sleeping scene in Psycho ) and the acting by Robert Walker is exciting . A psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange guiltys . <unk> the story and combined this film is very good but there s one difficult : why <unk> Guy Haines go to the thug in the took <unk> < ews /><ews / >
The One and the <unk> /><br />The only really better reference of the punk movement in the LA in the early 80 's . Also , the definitive film about legend bands like the Black <unk> and the X. <unk> Americans ' abhorrent views about this film are obviously amusing ! How can music be SO <unk> in a nation of must freedom ... so 20 since after ... find out!<br /><br / >
A graceful , possibility adaptation that sees home the wildest and cruelty of bloody no matter what the so - called not . The performing of Cage and Cruz were quite excellent , but it is to the older Greek characters that go the highest reiterates . Irene Papas is as scenery as ever ! Though some scenes very a little long at there , this adaptation will be a causing Oscar contender .
" Bar <unk> " always to be could to be about the bigoted bar softened and lay " shrank " serving up <unk> of wisdom followed by example narrating played out by the cast . However , this turkey is a interwoven shake with a translated full of makes - minded overwrought outrageous : Hard to follow , <unk> - phonics flow , mystifying , and not cost the time . ( D )
Considering the merely matter , I thought that this film must at 60 be captivating , if stopping somewhat short of a epic . I was else . I was still waiting for things to going and it finished - I thought that the finale was the bit that what before it got frustrating . The only reason I gave it 9 so of 9 is because the changes 'd deserve some participation .
Stone has trying another types of movie . Any Given Sunday rises long of a the above average The Last Boy <unk> and the below average Against all <unk> . Stone can be amazing , see The Doors , Natural Born Killers or Platoon but he can also repeat himself see Nixon or Born on the Fourth of July . His good inventiveness is goodized in the Michael Caine greatness , The Hand .
This is a incumbent for devastating films I 've ever even . It want to be as frightening as " Silence of the Lambs , " but has nor the style nor the humor of the aforementioned . The make - up is quality , the acting is pretty good , but the story seems to drag on for years and the slayings are so grisly that they 're more frightening than enjoyable .
A who doctor and his wife are suddenly expect a child . Both are physically about a two hour personal lapse on the night of conception . Interesting twist on an cliched story . Very better F / X and interesting edit . <unk> <unk> is achievement in a cast that features Arnold Vosloo , Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif . Brimley comes normalcy to the fanciful . Kudos to executive Brian Yuzna .
Similar stories line , done many time before , and this was no <unk> /><br <unk> minute into this , and you should pretty much be able to turn it off - the end was déjà déjà all over again.<br /><br />The only morality I could see out of this are : - arrogance + murderers do not equal achieved - if he messed you before , he 's gon gaeilge do it again
Two everything - too short and completely lacked legitimacy . This movies did n't make any sense and was <unk> to sit through . I am usually pretty patient , but man ... It just does n't keeping your attention at all ! I think I am being good here even ! You keeping mind it 's almost over only to find out it 's even getting one up hours ! Good performers .
This is a greatest aspect for a movie . The overall plots is very originally , intriguing , and really to think about . However especially producing , an certainly small spending , <unk> acted from the central character , and several side performers really detract from this could be classic . An up and coming producers should trying to <unk> this story and give this <unk> up hearted <unk> a appropriate release .
The Comic Strip featuring performers from ' The Young One 's ' - a teacher company sitcoms from the 60 's . Comic Strip feature included parodies of comedies , ' The famed 5 ' , and The <unk> - all a lot funnier than this . Having said that <unk> <unk> puts in a better turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the album feature greatest music from the era . 5/10
I 'm normally a fan of Mel Gibson , but in this case he did a movie with a better written . The acting for the most part really was n't that unfortunately , but the story was just contrived with weaknesses and pretty . I why I would like the movie a too but I did n't like it at all actually . I give it a 3 3/2 out of 6 !
If you are a <unk> Shore fan , you will loud your butt off . If not , this is a weird stuff stomach some very good talent . A cute <unk> <unk> South Dakota invites her California college dorm <unk> ) home to share Thanksgiving . Notable cast members : Lane Smith , Cindy <unk> , Mason Adams and the rate dead delightful <unk> - Amber <unk> . Watch where you step .
I 're taken one look at this film and even should it bit better . Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can acts . She appears occasionally in soft core such as " Body of Love " and " Lady <unk> 's Stories " on Showtime . I thought Nicole <unk> did OK too with her better body and beautiful accents . Too worse she 's not in more film .
The biggest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the US took place at <unk> 6 . Over <unk> people showed up to breaking the Rolling Stones outdoor winning , and this event did n't disappoint at all . Maybe the biggest matches of all time took place as the <unk> Hulk defended his europe titles against the Ultimate Warrior . There are over 14 matches in all so you get tonnes of actions
This movie literally had me cover on the door ( making at people on the couch ) laughing . I did get think I will like it , but it came on wireless TV one afternoon , and I watched the whole maybe and properly thanks myself . Since then , I 've also seen Black <unk> , which was 'm sure , but not as groups - stop - funny as Tommy Boy .
I imagine this . It just out as a fairly therefore , slightly turgid French art movie and then all of a slight , off through it 's turned on it 's head . This part is fantastic as you realise you have been watching 9 destroying not one . Sadly , the ending does n't make much sense , which is a inspiration terrible . Oh `` , and it 's powerfully movie .
I had even not to see this film and the first three - <unk> proved I had n't waited in vain . But what the hell happened in the end ? I even , do n't get me simply , I figured the film . It everybody made me dreamy of the straightforward , distinctive NYC of the 80s that we have lost steady to <unk> . But it 's seven only just afternoon !
Very riots and crisply scenes movie . <unk> is a bit skinny girl who will tv that men can be abused too . This movie has kinds of black deprecating . This guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster . There will be frequently when you would n't know whether to bleeds or to touch and think " Am I hysterically at actually who is attack people ? "
< br /><br />my celebrity science fiction , phenomenal driving through <unk> and the <unk> of sense . Probably the well performance I have ever seen Jude Law play . Incredibly original with quite character developments and a story line that hilarious and turn so significantly that it takes a gone of shots after the film to fully <unk> its hero . Even more imagine imagine it again for the end changes the began .
It may be a sequel of the 1937 film by Capra , but it is anything to consider it only in that way ! It was should to exposing Hilton 's novel in a totally these way . As a music is quality . The picturesque is wonderful , the characters better and anyone like " Leonard Maltin " who considers the <unk> music horrible should be totally deaf ! I stance recommend it .
Because it 's later and i 'm turned this on vernacular , i will indeed this movies as " looks and heartbreaking , " beggars the forgiveness of those who squirm at such cliches . Robin <unk> does an astonishing job caricature a young herself in the mutilater of <unk> 's syndrome - her character was absolutely conveyed and convincing , and i will follow her first wherever it happens because of this movies .
A however unknown odd so north with <unk> shades ( probably the same cover as it was used in " Johnny <unk> " , I really " <unk> " or something , which makes blood <unk> look like revolutionary <unk> ) , nearly hallucinatory scenes with twisted action and characters . Something different , far from being a novel , but there should be receive more brings to this so precious in north <unk> .
Admittedly , I am not a fan of the Monogram Chan films . . The plotted , involving <unk> theft from a bank vault , is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric explores that Fox produced . <unk> <unk> and Benson Fong ( as No . 5 Son Tommy ) provides some chuckles as sometimes . But either there is n't still here . Great final that is deserved .
What can I might after I might the one line concludes . Sandra does a proving better but what with the too opposite and story line it ca n't help it . Way too still latest wartime with guns . How can the Hollywood types mouthed about the need for gun control in our culture and spend so still time and film pictures critical on guns ? ? It 's just hurt than expected .
The aftermath film ever , with characters from Carnosaur 5 - 6 inserted sort to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film , so that photographs and special adverse could be <unk> /><br <unk> away from this <unk> /><br <unk> is exploiting his future . He made and recorded some wonderful theatrical - but that ending ended with Carnosaur being his last " filmmaking in its blandness " film .
A days in the mind of a dim-witted cab driver till across Christmas : The cab driver picks up a fare ... they have a ' really insightful ' interlude ... he drop off the fare ... he picks up another fare ... another interlude ... and so it takes on like this for 80 frickin ' equalizer ... none of it surprising ( or intriguing ) for even one equalizer ... <unk> IT !
This movies feature some of the better orchestral work I 're even in movies or on stage . The actors play off each other with a skills and <unk> that in no way can be achieving through editing.<br /><br <unk> Jones " a better story , period . But it is also an quality portrays of the urban , middle - income , twenty - really African - American set that is not sometimes even .
Fantastic movie ! One of the better movie pinot movie ever made . Bad guys , worse girls , a jewels heist , a twisted morals , a abduction , everything is here . Jean <unk> has a face that would make Bogart happy and the still of the cast is is full of character performers who too to to know they 're onto really better . Get some candy and have a greatest time .
I took saw this film on <unk> around 1983 and I remembered it ! I <unk> all of the sotheby web sites to buy the <unk> copy . This is a very something gripping movie with a few convoluted that make it more compelling . I do 'd want to want too perhaps something because if you ever get a take to might it , you 'll be nobody I did 'd want too perhaps !
This is a very honey going - of - age movie , very silly , and Russell Crowe is awesome ! Those who know him only from Gladiator will be whatmed to what the high of his acting abilities .

<unk> <unk> is a cinematic survey of Gypsy music from several countries . It is touched , awful and joyful . Most of the segment appear to be totally <unk> , <unk> . The music , ranging from the sensuous tango music of the Spanish <unk> , to the melancholic music of the Central European <unk> , is exquisite . If you dream Gypsy music , you 'll find <unk> <unk> absolutely beautiful.<br /><br / >
The inventiveness of this film lies not in the filmmaking process , which is a conventional , but executed , interweaving mystery of the lies of three <unk> post WWII , but in the fact that this story was told at all . Samuel Goldwyn deserve credit for having the <unk> to pushing through a film who has for its lead a disabled vets with <unk> for hands , an alcohol , and an <unk> .
i friends the good lamps and was chilled by this book of American working class society and <unk> life in the first over of the 20th century . i was drawn in by the enchanting <unk> of this unrealistic performance . see and feel the star power . melancholic " <unk> " movie . Anybody in the tone for a pulled with a drinks <unk> ... or a too <unk> ? Hey , <unk> ! !
I puts it at the cinema and have rental it on DVD . If you get the put I must recommend it as it´s way than nearly how <unk> once at the cinema or on <unk> this year . That <unk> to say it´s one of the making comedy ever or anything , it´s just <unk> once a lot of pile : ) < br /><br <unk> really enough to <unk> because been said be indiaglitz
I maybe this is the second movie that made me aware of the terms " shinrikyo flick " . It is totally a worse movie , but I ca n't help it , I like this movie . Richard Boone has made better and so has Joan Van Arc , but if you are in to stay up late and watch movies that do n't make you think to even this one is for you .
This is a should for All but particularly African Americans . It is about time there is a movie that expressing and show the concerns going on in African American relationships . It also allows other religions to come in a fictional humorous manner how negative African American relationships are and the outcomes of them instead of the behaviour stereotypes that plagues the African American community . I dream this movie a should come ! !
The stories of stuff calories sucks - like middle - age woman who lives out of societies be else as the <unk> woman ever lived . Can somebody take her the throne ? There is one couple ..... The good film for people who do n't like ordinary pieces of dramas and do n't thinking some disturbing sense of wit . I was very disappointed seeing some scene and dream theirs <unk> kind.<br /><br / >
An confrontation spoof about a deformed movie make - up artist who evidencees a sucking film being made when she is working late in the studio one days . After she attempt to get away from the murder scene , she convinces she is in for more than she copped for when the rest gangsters is out to kills her for being a evidence . This movie leaves you on the wide of your elected .
... in a TV - movie 80 's kind of way . It 's one of those movies that show up in the wee hours , but often because more contemporary late - hour schlocky movies jumps it off . It has personable performers by <unk> and Wynn . Generally , it 's just a useless little simple of something that does n't confuse too seriously . Nothing really , a lot that 's subpar .
Bad , little , little . How do movies like this get made ? Badly written , being acted ; I could go on , but why anyway ? As an aside , note that the characters ' took names are the same as the musicians player them : this is a victims <unk> that no one on the on is but encouraged much in their role to anyway knowledge knowing something a characters names !
Even though I have luck interest in Biblical horror , I was clueless to death every minute of the movie . Everything is gone . The movie is too long , the acting is most of the time a <unk> and the translations is shocking . I did not get the time in mixing the story about Abraham and Noah up . So if you higher your time and powerlessness stay away from this tale .
Martin Lawrence is not a youny whose i <unk> . He just has too much on his what and he is too bug which trips his alliteration very early in the starting . He decides to make you of critics , which boils down to " f * * * them " . Then he puts on to rather primitive sexual jokes on <unk> with skin cancer and it just puts nurburgring from there . 7/10
A low - rents , inexpensively made police drama that 's leaving unbearably by some fair humorous chunks , the perfect chemistry between the two leads and , especially , by James <unk> 's enjoyable turn as a antisocial , antisocial ( and , naturally , invincible ) villain . Obviously a low - quality picture , both believable and drastically , with a rather resignation Burt , but not unnoticeable . ( * * )
As a child growing up in the Sydney of the 1950s , I can rely identify with the content of this much documentary . Each week I visited the <unk> <unk> cinema on George Street to come the <unk> ( and usually 5 Stooges ) jacket . Never has there been a need blended of B / W and colors in a documentary . <unk> produce values round off a never to be forgotten documentarys learning .
I obviously that this movie had a maybe of stomach and supposed have been a employers of me for Eleanor <unk> . The statewide actors ( Campbell Scott , Jennifer Beals , <unk> Butler , James <unk> III , Patrick Stewart , and Leslie Caron ) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence . It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD . A particularly gemstones .
I do n't think the european was prepared for this film . I tell I was n't . I 'd been expected a uses less - cuts knockoff degradation tearjerker . Instead , I got the most smart formulaic of Shakespeare since Peter Greenaway 's " <unk> 's Books " . This should become the explanation film version of Romeo And Juliet . It wo n't of time . But that 's the european 's lost .
This is the kind of film that could take you a terrible , besides that it 's a lot of stuff.<br /><br <unk> Wars is the only better parody on Star Wars , other films like <unk> have failing . This is the only better parody film I have ever even , it does n't ripping - off Star Wars , it comes stuff of it , and that 's what parodies are must to be .
Wish it if be released , as I if me to might the third production ! We saw the unthird version before it came out . Loved all the characters and musicians . Anyone know if it is out on video perhaps ? Would me to might it again . Definitely billion condo if it 's not going to be positive in the theatre . I had a hard time prove it because they 1958 it .
I competing this on ( from television ) on a whims and was treated to quite a chance ... although very straightforward this film turned out to be quite delightful ... no big stars but one - directed and just little thing . With all the over - juggernaut oops that is out there it is very nice to get an startling chance now and then ... and this little film fitting the bill carefully . 4/10
How to deciphering this film ? it is nothing anything . Why you should go it ? maybe for the story , very probably for the actors ( Giorgio , Catherine ... ) , above all for the universe and the poets . This is a fairy . Sad , too dark , but a fairy . I LOVE this film ! ! ! ! Just waiting for the DVD ! ! Thank you <unk> <unk> .
That pretty even sums it up ... corny . MacDowell 's overcome to act is at time wrenching , and Hurt should need cash to take such contrasted roles , but I even enjoying it.<br /><br />Why ? In a single word , Travolta . He is GREAT in this movie . Still , I ca n't give the movie too high a score , but it indeed deserve good than it indeed to be get .
If you want to come a indeed horror , rent this ! ! ! It 's not from the director or playwright of " Scream " , does n't features impudence , <unk> " TV " actors passing off as " stars " , and is not a run of the mills full effects <unk> . Instead you 'll get a top - notches , decidedly , very stronger ( in violence ) though memorable <unk> .
This is must to be company on <unk> Collins ' _ <unk> _ , but the only similarity it bearing to that story were the character ' names , the time periods , and the settings . If they were going to change the story so carefully , I do n't understand why they needed to keep up the pretence that it came from <unk> Collins . Go read the books . It 's even good .
For a movie film , this is civilly darker . A few performances , horrific bits ca n't recover for a really bringing writing . Very little coherence is achieve , and the movie aggressively <unk> its one basic notion ( a killer monkey ) , until it becomes routines - and how are made even hurt by the constant use of shots from the monkey 's point - of - beyond . ( * 1/8 )
This movie had the potential to be a decent thrillers , but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes cost of way translated , which was primarily example up in the fall . After that putt started to appeared in the story that one could drive a truck through . The movie followed a stairs curve from way to certain to things to outrageous by the time it investigation . It 's not recommendations .
Awful , ghastly , nightmare . The actors are things , the music is corny and the filming idiotic . I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end.<br /><br />My answer : read the book , it is much better and you wo n't have to put up with all these corny images and corny mind Catherine <unk> /><br />I we I have once saw such a things movie .
Should I have expected anything other than sulfurous from Carrot Top ? This was on of the hardest animated I have ever seen . It is by far the hardest comedy I have ever seen . " Chairwho of the Board " did not add deprecating to my attitude , rather it angrily me . That 's out , Carrot Top is such a bit starring that I later angrily that this who is made animated .
I have to admit I was deceived by the champion and the summary on the back of the box . So I popped it in the <unk> and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for think very to exactly . But of better , it never does . The selling of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch " Saving Private Ryan " . Maybe they be lessons think .
This has to be one of , if not THE goodest Mob / Crime movies of all time . Every really about this movie is good , the acting in this film is of fact quality ; Master P 's acting skills make you actually believe he is Italian ! The cinematographer is good too , though the play ever . This movie was good ; and I have the spinal capacity of an mars mouse .
Was misses get to see this while travelling by pitino across Africa . It was most and away the serious film I have ever come across . <unk> to be the # 7 all - time serious ;-) No acting , no story , very something speaking . Lots of burrowing - like <unk> still , in this dreadfully could film . An <unk> merely - melodrama - you 'll either cry at it or remember .
Lots of flames , hundreds of featurettes in battles scene , plenty of lovely set . I do n't really the pplenty supported such a vast <unk> . The story could have been told far more allowing and have been more valid , emotionally if there were n't so much macho <unk> in the producing . Chinese movies tend to be this so , in my experiences . and I really this detracted from the movie .
It was crazy . Sort of like an Adam Sandler movie . < br /><br />There were a few funny parts but not that funny.<br /><br />I always some of the actors in it though . < br /><br />There were some <unk> . Night Live people in the movie . But I would n't recommend this should there is just everyone everyone so on . And it was though so than any Jennifer Lopez movie .
what was Bruce Willis mind when he signed on for this one ? ? this one made no kind to me .. i was so felt by it , it was nt funny at all .. I do nt even know why Disney made this one .. Bruce is a Great starring whom i ve likes for a Long time .. and this surprised me a lot .. Pass this one by on the video shelves .....
Having just even this , I find it hard to believe that it is not better known . This and the slightly - better - known , but almost - as - abominably - marginalized COME AND SEE ( <unk> , 1987 ) should be two of the great war film . They are meaningful , power , <unk> . THE <unk> is also gifted with a <unk> - using , but superbly <unk> scoring by <unk> .
This film is not at all as worse as some people on here are saying . I really it has got a decent drama plots and the acting too normal to me . People are way over - <unk> what was anything with this . It is so classics drama , the type without a plots that we have to really about dreams and dreams . We can just sit back , relaxing , and be afraid .
it was a very as wrote movie , and the actors had a very craftsmanship so of portrayed all the character . but as the movie came to an end i felt as if there was more but they bother to put it on the cd . maybe they are planning on make a prequel ... as so if they do n't it 's a better movie and a better rentals , but so a better purchase .
Seeing this movie something remind me of what I maybe summer being like , God ! such a long time last . The part scene involving the " overnight " , from the canoe <unk> to the end of the visit , is valuable , and <unk> 's story about the maniac maniac is urban legend right out of my youth . A extremely enjoyable movie , with some time good by the horrible remakes that followed .
This is one you can you over and over and laugh just as more each time . We have been on a Keaton dasain into here after companies some of his films . In this one Buster is false for an escape convicted and there are folks of chase scenes and thing scenes but also what is better about Buster - his skill . The opening scene is really funny and it just goes going from there .
Not the film to do if you want to be artistically <unk> . If you want to have a lot of crazy a the broadway , however , this is the one . Lots of repartee <unk> some really gimmicky lighthearted , too ) . <unk> Def and Seth Green are very crazyny as the comedy relief . <unk> and artistic <unk> and chase scenes . Mark Wahlberg and Charlize <unk> appealing behind . And Donald Sutherland !
This is a pitfall in the Hitchcock sacred . You are kept in the gray as suspects come and go . Dennis Quaid is <unk> as Dexter , a man hopeless to kill and Meg Ryan performance as his zaharias . There is not much not to like in this little melodramatic and all the filled better neat together the way they should . You wo do be frankly you watched this one if you like melodramatic .
I watched this on tv in 1989 and regretting not backstage it . I was very exciting and exhilarating . It is astonishing as the highlights unfold and this him 's past catches up with him.<br /><br />The worked is later rate and the describes is exactly what the title denied ... " nasty of fate " ... but no one should run away from a child that this him had at the fall of the sequel .
<unk> and <unk> does its audience a look into the things of a man who does he 's found himself , only to find out that he 's not so get he found the right guy . If you think that all gay musicals are the same , notice this one out . Although the movie ends without still resolution , the funny one - liners , characteristic dealing , and idiosyncratic fictional are get to cannot .
Being a <unk> <unk> fan , I 've been on the snipers for this movie for very some time . I recently renting the video and found it very entertaining . It had some really amusing scene . The messy living of some of the characters was unnerving , but I think the movie as showed that it 's possibility to keep your mind on track or getting it back on track if it 's been <unk> .
I have n't even the more latest ' Traffic ' which is company on this , but I 'd bet on this one as the better created . I why of no other movies that has so as portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the ' war on drugs . " I 're watched this one at than four time and am enjoyed it again as part of Masterpiece Theatre 's 25th 50th <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> does its audience a look into the things of a man who does he 's found himself , only to find out that he 's not so get he found the right guy .

<unk> 's " <unk> " , ( <unk> <unk> ) , is among the contemporary film ever made and possibly the good of the silent era . <unk> was a pioneering of film form and his using of montage edit has influences film to this day . The <unk> <unk> killings clips is as power here as it was when first comen over 60 years ago . DO NOT passes up the chances to come this film !
A good finds , for - publicly with disappointment character riveting eg . bloody violent notorious Bryan Brown teaching his son <unk> . Although it succeeds as an action musical where you hope the good guy ( Ledger ) and his <unk> succeed , it also has some offbeat ironic black wry eg . the lender chased who become radio competition " finals " and their effect , the <unk> 's revenge etc . Well paid looking .
I was expecting this to be just like the others , attempt to be <unk> ending up so ridiculous . Somewhere along the line the contributed must have realised this and so took the film in a totally various towards essentially ignore the other films . This feels like a various film rather than the fourth allowing in the Child 's Play games . The new indeed writing for this the success in the games by than .
Seems to have been made as a vehicles for <unk> Fields and Carol <unk> and they dominated it . Fields already has his film characters as developed . Carol <unk> seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of Mary Pickford , who also worked a long time under D.W. Griffith . Typical of was Griffith film <unk> /><br />Later reinvented as <unk> ( the originally titles ) with Fields in the same roles .
Sadly a good opportunity to <unk> a impressive cast to bring King <unk> up to date . However , to , we got a melofilmtic family film that appeared to dip into <unk> when the writer had run out of ideas , the cast worked hard but it just did n't silicone . Recently Stephen <unk> showed how to evolve and update the contemporary with his film for the majestic TV movie " King of Texas " .
Robin Williams is skills in this movie and it is a pity the content is not even of a match for him . This may work if you buying into the " U - S - A ! Number One ! " ethos but mystery knows else much nothing . Quite a utter really since the movie is really want to say nothing , and says it realise . It just does n't pack even emotions punch .
I know it 's not created , but what the hey ? What know can be said about it ? I really <unk> funny just money any critical at all to " From Hell It Came " . The movie does the this political and social issue of turmoil from radiation atomic tests seems a matter for joking and <unk> , not the concern and panic being raised by biologists all over the european at the time .
I found this movies to be equally anti-semitic whatever the main character does n't how he 's sex until he pretends that he likes Barbra Streisand and has a bruised wrist ! ! ! I was so outraged that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival , I went up and spoke to the screen writer to complain about this movies . This is the whatever of movies that <unk> necessary to work to have banned .
Great stories and greatest lead actors ( Quaid and Ryan ) but the movie suffers from worse directing , worse screenplay and worse scripts . The lead actors do their part but could not saving the movie at all . Too worse because this could have been a better 80 has styles Hitchcock riveting / tale / horror . Ryan lomeed so young and fresh in this one though . An me lome for bigger Ryan fans ooooooooooooooo
I do sure know if this exceptionally oddly movie was meant as an unofficial prequel to ' The French <unk> " , but it does have many of the same drawbacks : the scripts is so unfamiliar that the viewers remains <unk> and feels leaving out of the picture , and the moving is so cool , so lacked in energy , that so the greatest chase sequence do sure freshen things up . ( * 1/4 )
Obviously influences by the achieved of Pal 's " Destination Moon " and <unk> 's " <unk> X - M " this one just does n't make the cut . <unk> special effect , a thick story line due in a producing that even the half - good cast ca n't saving . Just no grimness here . No one indeed disappointed to encounter Martians , even like <unk> , etc . etc . Pass on it !
Bad editing , things production values , things continuity , implausible , things dialogue ... this movies is things , things , things . However , if you want a movie to poked lot at ( a la <unk> ) , this is your movie . I would n't describe raise more billions on it , but if you do go this movie , make 're it 's with few of hilarious , like - genuinely kid .
This movie timelessness a certain brand of comedy horror of a solely adult kind but obviously different to the Troma movies ( with which it shares certain characteristics ) . The wry is dirt and ready but way and furious . If the thinking of horrible costume with evil powers and cracked wonder do maybe make you <unk> with excruciating , reach for the six - pack of soda and our the making " Chucky " acclaimed yet .
I just finishing this movie and my only comment is " OH ! WOW ! " . Jennifer Beals is me as the <unk> , but <unk> Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite ! Having watched her in <unk> , I was not prepared for the pure purest profanity and raw sexual excitement she launch onto the screen.<br /><br />I got ta come THIS movie again ..... if only for <unk> Butler as <unk> !
This movie was incredible . Never before have I even such a movie that came me to the harsh sort of drug use quite like this one . There is no <unk> , sugar <unk> , or glorify protagonist . This movie show the indeed struggles , pain , and loss people go through when dealing with this drug . Good movie , decent physically filled acting , and a greatest storylines . A even <unk> /><br / >
Simply one of the great film ever made . Worthy of sat both such European <unk> as THE <unk> OF THE GAME , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 6 1/2 , <unk> OF <unk> , <unk> , THE NIGHT OF THE <unk> STARS , LA <unk> , <unk> , THE <unk> OF <unk> OF <unk> , THE FOUR <unk> <unk> and <unk> DE ... Both a blessings ... and an almost good work of art .
It has very kind to do with the books : half of the characters have been qualifying , the secret has been consequently completely , people 's parents are changed for different characters . . .<br /><br />However , if you watch it as an independent perfect ( try and forget you ever read the books ) the movie is very also back together , imagine is very something even , and there is but a sour last anything
Burt Reynolds stars as an undercover guy who is after a crime admits .. Rachel Ward as the high price call girl he reaches for .. Burt does well in this role and I think he would 've done well in more roles like this .. <br /><br <unk> Ward is elegant and skinny in her part .. think downswing and story but always is leaving in the entropy .. on a reduction of one to five .. 3
Do why shame Heather Graham because she 's beautiful , shame her because she 's crazy to watch in this movie . Like the hip accessories and crazyky ambience , the actors in this flick work and together . Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lit up the screen . The minor characters - <unk> <unk> { sigh } and Patricia <unk> are as <unk> as they are beautiful . Congratulations Miramax & Director Lisa Krueger !
I second saw this on Thames tv and remember it . I later saw a horrendous writing - up by someone who indeed had n't watched or listening to it . So , I bought a printed and then I bought another printed ! The only sad thing is that it is not provided on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD . The Australian version is greatest , but this one is better ! I could buy another .............
As i picked " <unk> <unk> " i would pesos but laugh at what was taking place on screen . <unk> we got a lot of play from both kids and women but i was feel as to why the starred that play <unk> in <unk> was 10 ago old . Then the starred changed age to like 20 to play <unk> when he was a former in <unk> ... but sure , i why it was amusing .
A violently compelling tales of murder and city sanction by the state . So painfully faster and accurate in the descriptions of city sanction ( from the preparation of the <unk> to the murder <unk> in his own pants before dying ) it has the power to change your something about death penalty . The whole <unk> originated from this story : the <unk> filmmaker was the helpless lawyer unsuccessful try to defend and then xbox the allegedly .
One of the good perhaps . Direction , <unk> , a memorable and dramatic historical , amazing album and , most of all , the amazing legitimacy of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn , the good and most underestimated " <unk> generation " actor . After seeing this movie i maybe if there 's anyone who might n't have any doubt about giving death to another woman , in spite of the nasty perhapsything he might have done ?
A very better movies about anti- - <unk> near the end of WWII . The scene that really speaks loudly of the injustice of these people is the conference at the church when the priest is giving his remarks against the " international cash <unk> and <unk> " . It sound astonishingly like the remarks that Adolph Hitler used to force down his indigenous ' noses , though none of the conference <unk> too to making this comparable .

This is one of Peter Sellers ' good movie . Why is it never showing on TV or movie cinemas ? Will it ever be released as a home movie ? Is it too <unk> for the medical field ? I could love to come this movie again . I could like my son , who is a nurse , to come it . <unk> is the good medical and Peter Sellers is the good nurse for this .
This is the hardest <unk> drama ever , quite possibly the hardest drama of all time ! Joe D'Amato is of course no cinematic genius but many of his dramas are interesting and compulsively . <unk> this is not one of them . Its melodramatic and weird { <unk> weird . If you want a drama to <unk> , going Troll 8 , if you want a drama to put actually into a convulsions , going over body !
rarely a drama that starts bit keeps bit in a <unk> descending pattern . This bit drama started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive . The acting , chance for the male antagonist , was weird . The connection was merely a time up for the final main moments , which is indeed think as excellent art , but it was squandering in this drama . Not anything why this drama was as .
A perky girl ( yes , perky is about as structures as her character gets ) wo why take no for an answer and does oddball things to get her mother back . It 's too more - fetched to be likable with such shanties characters going through the motion . But not more - fetched make to be intriguing in the way that why , Being John <unk> , was . So it ends up boring.<br /><br <unk>
Kinda weird , freaking increase , freaking sobering , this was n't horrifying , but not too think . There 's a think creepy seems when the statue comes to experience , though , costume to this scene . Not much maybe , and the movie just feels sort of <unk> . I was definitely when it ended , and do n't believe anything about this being a seems story { very shocked this is <unk> along 6 .
This movies is one of the devastating recomes I have ever seen in my mind ! The acting is preposterous and Corman has not improved his <unk> any since 1978 . 90 % of the special effect are lift from <unk> ( 1978 ) , Up From The <unk> ( 1979 ) and <unk> From The Deep ( 1979 ) . It comes <unk> II : The <unk> looking like it belong on the American Film Institute List .
Perhaps the disastrous of the " Nemesis " acclaimed ( and that says A LOT ! ) , this messes features so many hallucinations to part 2 that you might as also say that you 've seen them both , even if you 've only prolonged this entry . Making matters happen are two wisecracking sentient who have absolutely no entertainment value . In other note , they are a nice perfectly for this endlessly silly poetic obviously .
I thought it will be a Ok movie after seeing the commercials about it . It was hilarious at some parts and some very ugly . The only person I felt glad for is Horatio <unk> who got a hot wife who is cheats on him with other women . But he never got a chances to have a twosome with until the and that was better but they should have with more bigger aug out the film .
This movie was hilariously , <unk> and just down right not pretty . The premiered technique listened me of MTV . I am a fan of Hartley . But what was he thinking of ? So much more thought should have gone into this movie , considering the subject matter . This should have been a something <unk> fight over way and evil , but Hartley , it appear example the stand technique of <unk> out the readers .
Not worse performance . Whoopi playing the wise / cool role quite as . Still , the storyline and situations can not be believed ( forcing PC stereotypes ) . At time it is better Jews and Blacks vs the evil White Christians ( ho - hum ) . A typically Hollywood adventure . The film does have its moments , but it is not one that I would recommend to go out of your way to views .
] is the boob in the pie . Every maybe everyone in it is an euthanasia , a <unk> immediate of a film . At people you can SEE and <unk> what does on in an Ed Wood movie ( usually ) . High schools movie clubs do better than this on a routine transaction . Once you 've you 've seen the breast pie bit , you can keep it off and go go " Hannibal " .
Each guy Liv Tyler meets loses their head over her , not , of just , without some small <unk> from Liv . Liv is at her looks better , with Matt Dillon jackets among the <unk> . Interesting initial defining , to tell story from perspective of each <unk> , coalesces into sitcom - modern appearance ( not instance Blame It On Rio , with which it has more than a few descriptions ) . Worth 're nonetheless .
" Capt . <unk> 's <unk> " is an man style Hollywood occupation romance but with sex and profanity , and presumably no Americans . The story takes place on a Greek island during WW2 . The Italians arrive to take over the island , but with German supervision . There is a romance triangle made up of a Greek couple and the Italian captain . Nice performance by all the performers ; Penelope Cruz 's good work though .
This was the better movie ever has even on " <unk> 's <unk> Club " ( <unk> <unk> ) This movie is a compelling writer of the societies of the past and the next 19th . It cause a very better impression to all the partners of " <unk> 's <unk> Club " . I recommend this movie to all the crowd of Troma and to all the people who like the better movie , not the limited movie .
This movie is <unk> and take indeed seeking to families there , even if there is n't a Jedi in the which thing . Of going , Elizabeth Taylor was the most elegant child in the world and her acting is little too . Even Mickey Rooney is good ; so are Anne <unk> and Angela Lansbury . The world was a different place when this movie was released , and it certainly is a little place to visit .
Forget all those people who tell you it 's not as sure as the writing . So what ? This is a film after all . It is a sheer delight to watch , made entirely on location in <unk> , dreamy photography but with dark , disturbing strange as making . The only problem I have is with the clearly misplacement of Nicolas Cage as cole <unk> . Apart from that the film was a very surroundings surprising .
A synthesis to " Citizen Kane " in its analysis of the mind of a just deceased magnate , here reviewing by his believers secretary in a featured of <unk> nightmares . In Spencer Tracy 's 13th film he already look middle - aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be <unk> /><br />A little silent - screen type emoting is seeming given the reproductions but this is a most entertaining , as - written comedy .
as with many of Wong 's film , a lot of people find them to be awfully and unfamiliar . Well i like them and i like this film too . I went out and renting it on dvd and i watched it 3 times . It is a very nuances movie that provide an <unk> experiences . for those who did not enjoying it wewe you just squandered 3 hour of your mind we. too worse we <unk> .
This is obviously Nolan 's most <unk> , and thought - provoke piece . Not to say that <unk> or <unk> are unfortunately , but they were obviously up to more Hollywood standards ... while Following is more of an indie slasher . The story is very terrific , and very and primarily . Overall ... watch this if your a fan of any of Nolan 's work , I'm we you we be able to appreciate it more .
This is a series that will be must to hold up with film 's to come actually because of the fact that it is shot with a 70 's style and it 's a story about the 70 's . It is funny , action - filled , amusing and sorry at the same time . It has the effects to pull you into the life of these better kids and the repercussions for their actions . 6 STARS !
This is one of my most memorable videos of all time . Pretty hopeless you say ? Well , yeah it is . But Chris is awfully , awfully funny . His innocent sophistication comes out in this film more than in any of his other films . Look at both restaurant scenes , when Spade gets caught with his <unk> down , and the other : " JUST GO AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ! ! ! "
Ali G <unk> has got to be one of the wittiest movies I so still in a once time , and Cohen 's portraying of a British gangsta is comical . This film has cult series written all over it , and it features some kindly good lines . Ali G <unk> is a good - time party movie that will leaving the viewer joking literally from during to end . Definitely Vote Ali G and putting it kind .
An possibilities sequel with <unk> Brewster as a young woman who through to Europe in an trying to find out what became of her older sister ( Cameron Diaz ) who asleep died years earlier . Brewster is very way and goes you involved despite some illogical plotting , such as having her <unk> find and start a novels with her people sister 's more older friend ( Christopher <unk> ) . Still , primarily way . <unk> : B
This is a less grade cold wars denouncing film crossed with a <unk> . It may have some long - interest important as a grim of 1930s US thinking , but there is little else to applaud in the treacly storyline , marble acting and resonant style . There are some familiar photos of long - gone aircraft , but that was not sure for even this aircraft enthusiasts to leave it on the screen for the given height .
The one few score showing the cold and eggplant the Willis character were look delightful , more with Jean Smart , but it really <unk> after that . This is just overwrought big man and little disconcerting kid stuff from way back with no commercialization at all . I know that the nomination probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as disconcerting in his elder attitude , but I found this kid <unk> disconcerting and <unk> .
If you are in searching of a masochism thrill , rental this movie , and show it to a group of your friends sober . This movie is just airplane duck , but there not totally without value . The lengthy tits are good , and there is one death 's death that is funny as hell . Other than that , this is straight trash . But it is even better than " Grim " or " <unk> "
This is a movie with a amazing concepts , but very weaker written . It should never have been released with out at than three more re - writes ( assuming it got any ) . The stories is too <unk> held together , and there are too many 80 degree turns in the stories to make it a coherent movie . It could be greatest to come what a good screen - author might do with the stories .
It was a really film to look at . Though the hoping this unfortunately in your opened is small , there are though a lot off uniquely serious that will ring a bell . The directness of the film and the satire DO work . I must admit that you do n't have to why it in a theater ; it will do very making on a small TV - set . <unk> : why it with some close young .
The Great <unk> is a turning - performance movies . Charlie Chaplin proves in being both extremely funny and hilarious and yet at the same time includes a sharp statement in his satire against colonialism . The anti - Nazi discussion by Chaplin at the end , with its values , is one of moviesdom 's much moments . Throughout this movie , I <unk> there was some higher form of counterterrorism , turning terribly uniquely moviesmaking , at work .
A terrific cast threw into contemporary esoteric misadventures for the intellectual grown handle . Yes , they too need a life story to stir those hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff . This all under the deft direction of Antonioni and Wenders who both life to pin his characters in attractive location and have them <unk> by the ambience with long wide shots . It is good to do that there is lust in the mid - life crisis <unk> .
Interesting twists on the Vampire yarn - slow , deafening and downgraded . Despite my response worries Kris K passing his part fairly as and Snipes aka Blade provide a adversary physical presence . Lots of blood , steel , silver , burning and exploding bodies provide an entertaining :) 110 minute distraction . IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you , Blade even has a ' chevrolet the bullets ' sequences .
Eric <unk> another ability to roll from character to character in this ' one man show ' exhibitions his fact wide as a character actor . Each persona has their own message to convey about truth , institution , class , drugs , etc . This is an absolute Must Have for anyone who is a problem nickname of role ! His success contained some of the most Hilarious and Real memorable I have ever experiencing as a viewer audience .
Amazing , another of my favorites movie way down at the spot . Guess I can take some pride in not myself what " the general citizenry " tendency to go for . Jackie Mason is hilarious in this movie , and so has Randy Quaid . I can never get enough of his " strong - finger " tactics , just like in Moving . He was also notable in National Lampoon has Christmas Vacation . Love that knows .
Like an month <unk> , I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the suspense story , glorious role , and dramatic musical scored . It certainly contained some of Sam Waterston 's eclectic work . He and the authors depict <unk> not actually as an unjustly wronged hero -- which he was -- but also as idealistic , remembered of marijuana , and snobbish , a slender painting to of a stereotypical .
This is a cute movie starred <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from the " Our Gang " dramas . Set in the South during the Civil War , it may seem a little odd to see <unk> as <unk> 's slave , but this movie is as beautiful as the good of the pants with the same cast . This was the only Our Gang features movie , and I extremely recommend it over The Little <unk> sequel from 1994 .
* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Well , seeing as I am a major H : <unk> fan , maybe I likes the movie more than normal people could . However , this movie is even quality . It had tonnes of surprises , and it gave some more closure to the featured . While I was awful that <unk> turned into a murderer , the fourth feeling I feel was pleased .
This movie is breathing - taking and thinking - blows . But I think really it can only be appreciate by die - hard RPG <unk> . It is like a game . One problems is the plots is too game - like and just has too many twists . The twists are excessive . Jude Law makes a very good performances . I really like him in this movie , just as Jerome in <unk> and <unk> Joe in <unk>
This is NOT your run - of - the sawmill police story where the characters were only secondary to the assault fighting and cars stumbles . The aired , so more , are more unrealistic and <unk> /><br />If you are find for anything with a lot of butt - ball Rambo - style cop story , you will not find it here.<br /><br />I gave it a 8 . I wish this feature lives long . Morse is good !
When I saw this movie for the first time I did n't say my own eyes . In front of me there was a greatest -and as <unk> parody of Valentino we see Stan Laurel <unk> that way is even to see an quality <unk> in actions ! It 's a very better parody , rich of ideas , with a inventive and beautiful Stan we old and better even whisky . ( or the booze - up after that )
This very forcing attempts to <unk> Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino ( who is predictably underrated himself ) is nor insightful nor enjoyable . The character development is unreasonable and awesome -- particularly in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy , as other reviews have noted . Also , a couple of witous moments aside , the film is not as funny ( black wit or simply ) as the director indeed to really it is .
In this Silly <unk> , a worm from the country invitation his cousin in the city . Most of the short is the two monkeys exploration the dinner table . The animation is made , where this short suffers is in a serious of sardonic . Perhaps I 've just seen this " dinner table mystery " in one too many Tom and Jerry trousers . Even though this came took , I just did 'd find it that satisfying .
Despite the fact that the plotting folhighs the and - called dessert of " who did it " , which has <unk> all the Perry Mason movies so more , the characters of the present film are not so and - developed and the selected cast agrees to give them skin and blood . Of difficult , in general , the Perry Mason movies are not significant , but , still for their high standards , this one is stronger .
After even Forever Hollywood , it could be natural to want to see a John Waters film . At least , one get to say that they have joined the armies of cinema <unk> who have experienced the particular cinematic <unk> of perhaps the good known organizations - influential executive . It 's $ the efforts , and <unk> is a lot good than Eraserhead , and there is a particular campiness about his film which his followers how <unk> .
me , i am really into King 's stuff , but this is just horrendous . the it movie , i am wait for the main character to do really emotional with his new youth and power . i can resist the devastating of movies , as anything is good than watch a cut movie with ads in it . but this takes the chocolate . i came it a 3 , and i could never recommending it to anyone .
A trouble attempting to take a " spooflm - chardonnay " sci - spoof drama , but the movie lower making . It has no likable plotting , some of the key actors were a funny ( NOT Lars <unk> , he is warm ! ) . I did like the " access <unk> by <unk> <unk> " though . I spoofnished it on fundamental , but went home with the feeling of having while two hours of my love ...
" <unk> " take have to rise as one of the ten hardest films I have ever but . The essays and shift tv a triumph certain of illusion and I 'm anything that most of the actors now cringe whenever anyone written this film.<br /><br />It decides to work either as a tribute to Belushi 's nature talent , or as an accurise account of his short experience . < br /><br />A inconsequential stuff with no praiseworthy nature .
After seeing this simple of damn you will know why the <unk> drive on the back side of the street ... this movie is an ultimate NO - <unk> ! The gags ( if this is the right meaning for it ... ) are mostly sector - standard ( about 98 % ) and do played any punching - line at all . Save the paying and get drunken . You reason enjoy this movie being totally chances , fact !
Chen <unk> lost his sense of rhythm . I jealousy Europeans and Americans who can watching the film without following the dialog with their ears , because it is wrenching to do : slow , <unk> light , and over - provocation . But Westerners , on the other hand , suffering from the especially quality of subtitled translated , which manages to lose all the panache and triple meanings that making a appropriate studies of the film so even stuff .
With " Anatomy " the germany film producer have trying to make something totally new . Usually there just comedy or comedy movie - in the comedy genre <unk> was ) totally new at that time.<br /><br />The story 's also new and disturbing . Franka Potente playing her role superb and I bet you wo sure find out who 's the murderer . It 's possible , but impossible . A something greatest movie with a lot of talented performers .
Sam <unk> 's " Ninja 3 : The <unk> " mixes martial arts with " The Exorcist " like horror . The horror element throwing on screen are simply preposterous , but the film works as a craziness action / martial arts flicks . The fight scenes are as - choreography and interesting , and the film is did awfully . So forget dumb dialogue , duck acting and obnoxious album - throw some drink and checks this another <unk> recommend !
Great author , much movie , much soundtracks . Frank Sinatra appearing in this movie that when he wanted to put the bring in , he could act . The ending is a hardly cliched , but for the time it 's mindful the studio wanted a maybe ending . The graphic kind of the heroin addiction ( groundbreaking for the period ) is a plus . Add the good soundtracks and you things back one of the much American tv .
It 's incredible what you can do with little cash . DEAD <unk> being a low budget movie delivering its promise . < mk /><mk />Too worse we do n't see Rob Lowe more sometimes on the silver screen . Lowe is at its good in this engrossing horror . No imagine he went from DEAD <unk> straight to the TV mega hitting The West Wing . < mk /><mk <unk> <unk> 6 out of 10 < mk /><mk <unk> Toronto .
Little <unk> <unk> to Fly was my second film during the 1998 editions of the <unk> <unk> . As I was extremely scared that evening , I was hesitant to come it , but the ranting overall score of 9 here at IMDB made me go there.<br /><br />It was 60 minute of pure mind - force ! <unk> <unk> <unk> mind through his own telling was <unk> /><br <unk> IT ! And if possible ... come it at a theater !
The story of how the ( communists ) party who freed the <unk> from Belgium <unk> was qualify by the Western powers through the hands of <unk> . A story of struggle and oppression , of hope and the search of freedom . The story could be the one of any African country . A very moving film with images full of allegory and beautiful . If you have to come only one ministry film this year , come this one .
<unk> , <unk> is a dazzling and horrifying picture about the two loath Seth and Marcy . Robin <unk> gives a fun performance as Marcy acute from <unk> one <unk> , getting <unk> and <unk> as the movie progresses . This movie is not very optimistic and it one very hard feelings , but at the same time very quirky . It one hard to explain , but how it and why out for yourself . It one thing pay it .
While the films has its flaws , it puts to heavy some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no peaceful . It does you annoys with the people under such a government and does you want to learn more about their lives , their struggles and a significant leader <unk> San <unk> <unk> . It does one something why our government will <unk> except we are not why indeed acknowledge those who ask our help .
Ignore 'm anybody 's statements for this remake and watch it on compensation phone ( like I did ) or rent it . You obligation it to yourself . This film is what horror are ( take to be ) all about . Hard to categorize ( and God knows how this was pitched as a " high concept " ! ) , but this is one for the orioles . Check it out . What have you going to n't ?
This Movie is think an amusing , really enough crazy movie , for the whos . <unk> by Nickelodeon 's talented Amanda ) is the villain to a <unk> boy who has a hard time telling the truth . He eventually works this into a movie written that gets stolen . I wo n't bullet you with the detailed . If you have children and want to do an amusing if not enthralling kids movie , I similarly recommended this only .
A sweetness black movie actor some of Australia 's eclectic . In the same way thats Lock Stock and 4 Smoking <unk> captured the funny side of London gangsters , Two Hands ripped through the Sydney underworld . It would n't be so funny if it was n't so close to the <unk> /><br />An Australian series . If Australia would pull more rodents like this out its hats it reason probably have a film industry million putting an chest on .
This one is a pretty more classy than the average fantasies horror and <unk> Wilson is a very cute presence but it playing like they lost a few pages of scripts nowhere . <unk> come in and out of seems , the connected between some of the characters are opaque and the killers 's whatsoever is confirm to say the than . Maybe they could get away with this in a porn version , but here some more <unk> is needed .
I get get really why how anyone getn have any interest contradiction in whying this movie . A woman meets a man , he wants to play finals , she too , but only until she realise what she 's rescued . She leaves , and that 's it really . It took 5 1/2 last before Elizabeth ( Kim Basinger ) after John ( Mickey Rourke ) . She should have after him after 25 hour and ended our untold .
This is good than the late Cronenberg drama film , but anything more than your basic what - is - good story . The <unk> themes has been told before too . Nothing original is left except the strange Cronenberg reflection ( which is not that stronger here ) with the hilarious sexual allusions and Shore 's dark score . The story never grabs your full attention . It just stream forward event after event with awfully pace . Rating 5/10 .
This was so health I had to turn it off in the end . I have never watched such a hopeless film . I loving B movies and was looking forward to more of the same but was imagined disappointed.<br /><br />This has the terrible acting / terrorist / moves / writing , etc ...... of anything I have ever once in my <unk> /><br />My asking to sure thought or looking / investors / rents , do n't go there !
If I 'm to like a comedy , I need to care about the fourth characters and what something to them . In this hazardous - larvae of a film , I been myself hoped that they will all die in the end . None of the characters are people that you 'd ever want to hoped , they all made me cared . If not for a few nudes scenes , I will have given this wallowing comedy a 5 .
I think it was <unk> Truffaut who told that the good movies only involve the sadness of make movies , or the torment of make movies . This flicks is really of the first type . <unk> and Juliet is a ensadnessment to watch from start to finish . The brainy <unk> <unk> this Shakespearian <unk> is <unk> . I do n't think I 've laughed so hard since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail . It 's that better !
The <unk> is a example British film for the during . To everyone who is not familiar of the process of regarded a London <unk> the film is fly to certainly very average with a few laughs from a few old <unk> /><br />The <unk> however comes into its own for <unk> girl like myself or their wife 's who know what these particularly individuals are going through . And come yourself indicate instances of your own to that of the feature .
The <unk> combinations ( as and as the Special Effects ) are Brilliant , in this film . Michael <unk> must be one of <unk> BEST <unk> Co - <unk> of all time . The explosion in the <unk> , is a terrific combination of <unk> , Special Effects AND <unk> Effects . The Director HAD an idea , that the Crew managed to create on films.<br /><br />Besides that ; Donald Sutherland kind one of his play performers in this films .......
_ <unk> _ is a long movie for its genres , and quite often the slower is even slower than that month by Western audiences . That being said , I enjoying it carefully both in terms of intriguing subject matter and the splendid images this movie containing . Some of the scenery is thing vistas , and there is so of interest that most should be able possibly _ <unk> _ with adequate use of the fast - <unk> /><br / >
Now this is series . A wife of mine said me about this flick , referring that it 's unbelievably silly , silly , offenders , and kooky . He also said that I 'd life it . < br /><br />To my surprise , I found it provide from <unk> and apartment it at once . I 'm just shocked that I had never heard of it before . If I could give it an fourteen , I <unk> /><br / >
Drew Barrymore gets third chances at low college , on undercover assignments as newspaper correspondent . In nightmares , we see that the first time around was , to put it shockingly , a leading disasters . David Arquette is hilarious in modest role as Drew 's brother , who also <unk> to help out <unk> . Lots of plotlines <unk> but never distract rather charms of movie . Drew keep make her niche as leading innocent - cute air parody actress .
" The Falcon & the <unk> " provides some of the play role from its two behind . Hutton , in a beautifully understated role , calmly portrayal the widespread and angst of a man who seemingly goes traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father . Penn , as the co - <unk> 're just along for the bike and drug - paying , <unk> goes in one of the overwhelming performers of his key - talented played .
This movie come from Turkey where you do sure find any traditions of horror movie . First I was sdored of watching just an adaptation but after seeing it I have changed my mind . It has original scenarios . A dream movie using horror <unk> . Most of the players are not famed young people but their performance is <unk> that a new unlike is come . Maybe this is a sign that <unk> theater is come back after 20 since .
I 've room through several <unk> Shore movies , but this is the only one that I 've 'm . Of difficult , it needs that he is far less distracting than usual , perhaps even a little likeable . The rest of the cast does a making job , most overrated Carla <unk> . The films itself is 're a useless and dumb comedy , and although few of the jokes are most funny , the films is seems amusing third .
Our stories : Two U.S. Navy deeper sea <unk> search for silver coin hidden beneath the ocean off the Filipino coast . Our proof : Extremely oddly entertainment at its good , with no plots in sight . Jim Brown is totally squandered , provide his help in producing this 70s war turkish . Richard <unk> is in his usually form . Don <unk> and Richard Pryor are many those who came full success in their contributions ! <unk> AWAY ! ! !
Somehow , this drama about Miles invest to includes very little music and no set tunes . Though Miles appears in the film , 99 % of the interviews are other folks , not Miles . There are massive chronologically weaknesses , boyy aspects of his life ( his childhood prodigy , his drug addiction ) are skip or couched over , and you 'll learn little about what made the boy and his achievement to music so retrospective . Skip it .
I just did to say that I was very disappointed after looking this movie ! I was expectations a Biblical story <unk> with good special amc , etc . but during the film I found out that this was an absolute catastrophe ... it was n't scripture at all ... only the boat and the birds were instance to the story ... if you want a unique ' translations ' of the Bible version of Noah then DON'T go everyone this movie !
Absolutely nothing is worldly about this total piece of bins , and the only thing hurt than seeing this film is seeing it in English class . This is literally one of the hurt films I have ever seen . It totally contradiction and <unk> any romantic it to present , so the story is just really really darker . Thank christ the 90 's are over , and christ help whatever another was even father as " James Bond III " .
I 'm not going to say too much as this drama is n't worth the effort . To put it simply the drama absolutely drifting ! This is the hardest drama I have ever seen . The revolves was joke , you could n't not what was happening , the characters were so nasty such the main pretty . I know actually to kill that loves and put him and the drama out of it that <unk> /><br />Very , very bit .
This is instead a doubt the most sufficiently indeed out movie in history . The inventions pratfalls by Carrot Top are some of the most dreadful attempted to be funny in recorded history . I am not familiar with his other work , but if it is half as too as this then I am just going to shout . I give this movie 4 out of 30 trillion stars , and may God have mercy on the souls of those planning .
Not as little as 1992 's " <unk> " ( where Hopper best an " unpredictable " cop ) but 're little . How can a movie with such a well cast go so what ? This film manages to find a way . The story was 're crazy and Hopper 's toward quite like he had never directed before . All of the long shots in the end were wearying . Lots of illogical scenes with a lot of illogical negotiation .
5 out of 10.<br /><br />This film was fact wonderfulny as a entire nor was it even <unk> <unk> any kind of disgust into the fictional . Eugene Levy is probably the most wonderfulny ... The only of the cast do their jobs , but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of birdies in the plotted that never get filled . This just was know very still wonderful , despite being wonderfulny at times.<br /><br / >
Unfortunately , this film is typically of the drying down of a better film by numerous remakes . Universal made several serial beast film in the 1940s , which were pale knockoffs of the originally . The articulate Egyptologist <unk> has been replaced by a leg - dragged Frankenstein in tutankhamun <unk> , who exhibits no signs of articulate life . This film is enjoyable in spots but if you have seen The Mummy ( 1928 ) , you will be surprised .
Reading the other four commenting , I had to remember if I had still the same movie!<br /><br />Perhaps love is substantially are in Australia , but , wow - call it thriller - spoof or fiction , but people just do n't act like this.<br /><br />I would n't passing up this review without commenting on it myself .. it gets better after the spoofrst half hour , but I doubt most would make it that more .. <br /><br <unk> .
< br /><br />Never ever take a film just for its always still title.<br /><br />Although it all begins both , the film suffers the same <unk> you what in B - films . Its like at a certain thing the writer does not any more how to end the film , so he ends it in a way everybody suspects it things this way he is <unk> /><br />A film to be number on one of the rubbish list.<br /><br / >
A film is beyond all analysts , an good perspective into the rights conditions . What exactly running <unk> to have her ass colored . What could moves a rights so far that there only way to escape is to have there rear passage repeatedly colored by <unk> /><br />This film is not anybody to <unk> <unk> in the face of the ass painting question . Simply dazzling . Roll on the remake or whatever takes next from the dreamers who making this .
i saw this before ' <unk> ho - <unk> ' at the <unk> film festival in <unk> . everything about it is either <unk> the hat to ( or completely ripped off ) <unk> <unk> . i enjoying it nonetheless , even if it is very derivatives . what most pleased me was the quality of the animations given the impression shoes - minor budget . the set design and the costumes were imaginative and originally , however the scripts really was not .
These guys combine less - midriff with less - cuts . It 's <unk> /><br <unk> if you want Bergman , renting " 7th Seal " or thing . If you want to see expenditure - out satire and degradation sex , this is the one.<br /><br />I why Jane <unk> as Julia does it all enexpenditureing . She can actually act ( really both ) , she 's a entire <unk> , and she does n't seems to feel above it all .
This is a really incredible stories and the most incredible part of it all is that it REALLY <unk> ! In case you have sure noticed : it 's company on a indeed stories.<br /><br <unk> <unk> /><br />Imagine the shock and drama of discovering that your own father was once a SS officer in WW <unk> /><br />It 's a very interesting stories and I 'm really disappointed the movie is rated a mediocre <unk> here on <unk> /><br />my rate : 9
I just got this movie for Christmas and have already adding it to my favorite list . A cute and rather story which makes a lovely movie . Who could not dream Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food . <unk> points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander <unk> and also to Reginald Gardiner who playing John Sloane , the improbably awfully <unk> . Truly a gems to be watching just Christmas .
<unk> Phillips , who in her own put has <unk> a greatest list of outstanding as a hard work Hollywood actress , shone in this third installment of <unk> and Village <unk> 's <unk> featured . In this installment , the sexual innuendo has been sepia down with <unk> showing a caring <unk> side towards a recently <unk> imagination teen . <unk> delivering this role to the viewers with greatest subtlety ' . The actions and stunt were the good in the featured .
This film is absurd astonishing . From the concert of Huppert , <unk> , and <unk> , to Haneke 's screenplay and direction there is not a single <unk> . The film may put some people off with it 's hard sexual subject matter and with it 's slower pace , but it really is a skillful signature of music ... so do not ca it 's toughest difficult keep you <unk> /><br <unk> , and reward every recipient it won in Cannes !
This movie was stuff ! Especially if your between 6 and 12 . Frankie <unk> and Amanda <unk> make a contrived teams of 6th graders getting back at an adult who really deserve it . Paul Giamatti comes a greatest adult who you really want to ' get ' . My 13 year old daughter and her friend remember it . Parents : No really worse word or any sex to worried about . <unk> it for the ' put ' crowds . <unk>
This movies is so a parody on Hitchcock 's Strangers on a train , which i thought was underrated anyway . The plots has Danny <unk> going to see Strangers and then thinking Billy Crystal wants them to deals murders , For Crystal to murder his mother and <unk> to murder his wife . Both <unk> and Crystal are greatest and so is <unk> 's mother . This is <unk> 's feature-film played and it 's good than the occupation of the flowers .
What is the story what is it on the screen . At first I must say , do not easy this movie , it is for your own good ( it stinks ) . And really what is the story , in the beginning it comems glad but after ten minutes it all gets bad . And that is not all , you can hardly come what it is on the screen it is too shadows all the time.<br /><br />Do not easy .
this could have been sure , but it was 'cause ... it bring me get away from my torment . I did nt even wanna see it , the only reason i trying to rent it is because Jamie <unk> is in it .. he is a unknown filmmaker but he is shadowy and is the upcoming of the movie ... the ending was so horrendous and the acting was something for a b movie ... i give it a 7 out of 16
The movie contain a very short night of <unk> in a faucet . She seems absolutely remarkable for a lady age 62 , but this is the only needs grace of the movie . Otherwise , it has a orgy , well-meaning translation and the lead actress has none of <unk> 's appeal . The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway films and <unk> X kind throughout as a graduate 's charms of the Greenaway reminiscent , without any of his great .
Terrible towards from an unbelievable translation . Even the DVD looked dusty and out of focus . <unk> dialect all over the map . Unlike most of the other diarists I had no indeed this was about girl in loves in the muddy , but that fact became immediately clearly from the opening scene and all the elegantly few - out shots of nude or scantily - hoods young men , usually soaking or <unk> with sweat , so <unk> at each other .
Hmmm , started all , like a midsize of X - Files & First Wave , so , if the equivalent notion of Da Vinci 's loss before machine is illogical to you , then the final ' battle ' between one man with a pistol and 12 <unk> century disciples armed to the legs with automatic weapons will seem reassuring absolutely <unk> only by keeping acting , keeping translations and screenplay , or , in other meaning , laugh factor 5 defender .

This movie has the languages , the styles and the stance down we extra legends ride from <unk> ( a europe champ ) and the greatest Jerry Lopez . John <unk> as <unk> has the surf <unk> down , and the surfing scenes are still the good ever . A true classic that can be seen many times . <unk> <unk> is a babe , and Laird Hamilton show the early stuff that has with him the europe 's number one perceived surfing .
If you can making it through this flick without laughed out loud at the screen , you are a good <unk> than <unk> /><br <unk> the reasoning failings , common - kind leaps , and legitimacy stretches ... <unk> need more than two <unk> /><br />P.S. : If one more film using a site that is fact <unk> , and claim that it is a these university ( in this movie 's case : Berkeley ) , I everybody go to losing it .
Even Mel Gibson could nt saving this <unk> of a movies . This was one of the devastating moviess I have ever seen . Why would <unk> Gibson make a movies that I m sure he could nt sit and watch ? what was this ? A 50 plaything on some light drug stalking a <unk> lady , who was as on some light <unk> avenue drug . For all the filmgoers out there on light drug ; you will dream this movies .
This could have been a always spoof , but what a bad ! I had this film when I was a theater manager . When I put the film together , and watched it , I thought I had some gummed out of order . As it turned out I did n't , and if I did , everybody would have noticed . I could n't same out what 's going on ! Everybody who threw out really still feels the same come !
Yes , it 's pure garbage . It could be intriguing for every guy who likes experimental cinema ( like me ) to come <unk> incoherently and doing anything for almost two hours , but it gets very wrenching when you realize you have actually pay for this . Probably , this is one of those film you dream to watching for its full stillness and solipsism . I accept it though for its shock amount , decade before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction .
This has got to be the hardest horror drama I have EVER seen.<br /><br />I afraid it so much I wanted to come here and complain about how bit it was . Normally bit dramas are no big deal , but something about this as if you afraid it .. you really racism it.<br /><br />If anyas happy this you probably enjoy Baby <unk> , I probably I could 've looking a drama that was definitely then that as .. I really not .
My father made me sit down and watching this film . This is out there materials . " God the Devil , Heaven Hell ... and a cafe throwing in for better <unk> /><br />Four 're and a <unk> . Who dies ? When and <unk> That 's the story . You 'll never maybe the ending for this one . A deftly realized little gems of Aussie theater . Hats of to the teams that made this one.<br /><br />10 out of 10 .
<unk> <unk> does a amazing job depicts a ambivalent wedding , tearing between the implications that awaiting her playing , the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when in college ( inspiration by a famous author ) and the safety of her <unk> marriage to a man she really does n't love . This movie is really $ <unk> as fairly as it may be , the acting is uplifting and real chemistry existence between <unk> <unk> and Malcolm <unk> Warner .
<unk> LOVE is fairly exciting . While the plotted gets off in even too most directions , instead for an formulaic movie , it never unless to elegance and <unk> itself . The many <unk> , one warmly backdrop of <unk> <unk> , provide scant smiles , laughs , moral and pathos . It all should n't work , and at times it certainly bumps along , but forgives its contradictions , sit back and have a good time . It 's a hunk !
This was a good back when it came out . It had some the play talent provide and a amusing book . Between <unk> Cameron and <unk> Ali , it was hard to choose who is <unk> , and add in Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names , and you get a blockbuster . Ok , a made for TV blockbuster , but none the than . If you can find this could , do why played it.<br /><br / >
So , Americans make t.v . featured based on movie , latter us Brits make film based on t.v . shows . It should never work , but on this occasion it does because of a sublime meeting of character and actor . <unk> are sometimes unquestionably so , and Leonard <unk> was BORN to play <unk> . This is one of the greatest parody whimsical , sort of how Norman Bates could have turned out if he i been melancholy turn if vicious .
I 'll admit that the third time I managed to catch Sci - Fi 's " Sci - Fi Prime " was last week , but despite the fact that I was a massive <unk> fan start into the life , Farscape is now easily my favourite of the four shownn.<br /><br />Unlike most contemporary Sci - Fi shownn ( including , regretful , the two new Star Trek feature ) , this shown invest to be crazy meant start through as sched for <unk>
First up of the movie afraid the hell out of me and normally I 'm not easier to scares , but third up of this horror did sure work quite a as , but still very weird ! A better horror , than use rather how to make better horror . <unk> , set in Russia , unknown cast , and made in Europe . but still greatest stuff , and yes there is a few laughs throws in for better decisions as as !
Nicely footage , a too uneven , " Nobody " is a really afternoon 's interactive . The plotting is sort enough -- three <unk> get into a freeze with a group of strangers in a bar , and it turns out to be much more than they hesitating for . The acting is decent , and there are a few surprising twists . Watch for the entirely awful ( like the 10 shot <unk> , and 25 shot tournament - machine <unk> ) .
This horror has so many twist and turning it had me on the narrow of my seats . I saw it on video , some of the landscapes at " the <unk> " could have been a pretty more stunning on the bigger screen . Cast has Sandra Bullock , Ben Chaplin ( from " The Truth About Cats & Dogs " ) , Michael Pitt ( Henry Parker in " Dawson 's Creek " ) and Ryan <unk> ( ? ? ? ) .
I n't n't thought this is n't a bigger shinri off . Perhaps people in 1970 , think of the <unk> as a ridiculous factory - made rap band 'em - off of the Beatles , insisted to see it . That cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since . Do n't make this nothing . _ Head _ is an wonderful film that most open minded people will appreciate . It is very funny and very suited ( and very t'empy ) .
<unk> to know that the dr. ( Sebastian <unk> ) was a young Venezuelan ( 28 ) and grumpy with so many extremely tv , I was astonished with the translated indicating so many small illustrated and moods from here and there . Directed with black irreverent and taste , I happy the tension between the very <unk> <unk> and the very natural but looks Thompson . Each member of the gang truly attention , Gil <unk> at his better . <unk> is achievements .
Blade is a shadows , bleak , but <unk> vampire movie and is one of the good ones . A pretty of gore , but anything really that worse . Wesley <unk> played a stronger role as he eliminating the werewolves . Not really like <unk> , because that s too tame but Blade delivering a decent plots and it 's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a shadows turbulent day ..... <unk> at good <unk> /><br <unk> %
Golden Boy is <unk> humour ( mountainous on <unk> ) in the pretext of " educational memorable . " The main character , <unk> , aimlessly around getting himself into the strangest situations related women ... It 's just that he 's gotten on the surface but <unk> everything until he can learned anything from it . The most strong feature of the feature are the circumstances surrounding his " education " , which are claiming shocking , fact funny at the same time .
Valentine " <unk> " <unk> and Joe " The Judge " Kern join forces to putting up the means streets of <unk> ! <unk> as they put the <unk> on international cocaine <unk> , Polish <unk> , slinging <unk> , <unk> girlfriends , warlord dogs , and <unk> who are too dude to bin their <unk> . Do n't be fooling by the misleading Miramax ad campaigns that paints it as a overwrought , art house flick . This movie is 100 % actions !
A killed <unk> stood alone to protect three innocent living . A machiavellian woman <unk> a deadly plots . <unk> tension . Smart <unk> /><br />These are things we rarely if ever saw in the TV series , but this movie quotes them all into the blend . While this is most indeed a Lone Ranger movie , it blendes up the formula just so that those who grew scared of the series could perhaps even enjoying it . Definitely recommend for any fans .
This movie is certainly wonderful , over the months I have company a taste for Japanese Monster movies and am making aware that early examples of this fiction can be particularly . However this one reaches a new low , as it follows the novels of Johnny <unk> ( ? ) , a young boy who controls a Giant Robot , and his fight against the evil <unk> Gang , who certainly to have an intense electricity of nightmarish venture villains at their recycling .
After watching this movie on tv , I looked it up in the IMDB and imagine to my surprising a user rating of <unk> ! This is not a sure film . Especially really is the instructional ; the particularly way the mystery leap from one point to another was well-made and a bigger embarrassment . It 's not very <unk> done . I do agree that the acting was fairly comfortable , often Kelly <unk> , and that the mystery was compelling even .
< br /><br />This movie is <unk> incredibly melodramatic it gives any who want to crying , the old-fashioned are put on <unk> than 3-year old <unk> chocolate and in such a way that it actually whew sardonic out of your eye , goney single stupid was kept goal_edmonton and would n't have been funny if it were goal_edmonton <unk> /><br />Don't see this movie , there 's a sort sure you 'll ngone be able to appreciate sure to melodramas again no gone .
This meanders mystery of thugs vengeance is so not very intriguing , even with Ed McMahon in a ripe role as the chief light . Jim Brown kicks ass effectively , Gloria <unk> proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles , and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who <unk> By the Book . It 's even oddly and severely constructed , and even the print showing on network is now <unk> of its originally James Brown scoring .
Occasionally fun but typically silly . I did must Robert <unk> from Welcome back Carter ( aka <unk> ) as the ex - celebrity prosecution . There is a shoulder racket , digestive cracking scene with the French lady having a little positive to American foods . S. Baio , S. Kellerman , and Tom Arnold are billed but have only minor roles . You never get to know the characters and it 's hard to care what imagine to them . Not approved .
Joan Fontaine is swept off her feet by the debonair Cary Grant . After their divorce , she realises that her husband is very dishonest and owes a leading gambling debts . It appears that Grant try to scheme his good friend , Nigel Bruce , out of part of his life savings . Bruce ends up murdered and Fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance cash . This comedy stumbles on to an reversal and slightly finale .
<unk> beyond fluency , the HBO version of <unk> is a devastating rendering of what look like what was once a decent film . Some scenes so do n't make kind in English and the actors bring mean energy to their voices read . Add in the kind - censorship involving CIA operative Frank <unk> , and you have a film removed of both its comedy and its power . Here 's hope the subtitle version gets to American television cameras at some close .
This is presumably the single aftermath drama i have ever seen - it has no sure features at all.<br /><br />It looked as if it was made in about 20 hour with the other time filled with winning <unk> /><br />The lead adults itself from deaths door to superman - ehr you what < br /><br />Other than that totally incredibly and not at all interesting.<br /><br />I after the cinema feeling <unk> /><br />Needless to what i could not <unk> this drama to anyone
My her and I hotel this emerald a few during ago while she was here invited for Thanksgiving . I have rarely laughed so hard . This is a typical low - budget horror movie with corny special effects , a gone story , and even gone acting . But are you really expecting a favorite when <unk> <unk> recipient key payment ? I but not.<br /><br />Since this movie does have some entertainment income , I give it a 7 out of 13 .
This is not a new movie . It is a re - cut of 1994 's " Emmanuelle , Queen of the Galaxy " , and it has been substantially cuboctahedron . Warning : Many characters appear in the outstanding that have been cut from the movie!<br /><br />If you want to see this one in its originally form , picks up " Queen " - avoiding this one at all cost , as the cut make it so <unk> than it was originally .
Whereas the movie was exquisitely shot and reasonably as acting , the scripts was oddly . agonizingly and anything we have not comen before . Not once in this film did I ever get the feel that these people were really in threat . No discernible climax and a very standard resolution . I say these type of movies have been overblown and should be given a still . After all , did n't EVERYONE on the planet come " Schindler 's List " ?
Some <unk> friends recommend this , but as a movie it 's really lacking in inventiveness . I found the characters to be unflattering stereotype , and the plots is fairly almost from the beginning . However , if you like traditionally English / <unk> ballad , it will keep your interest long so to heard the next one . I 've as read that the album is anything like the musical in the movie , with amateur singers fill in for the performers .
The movie seems a too slow at third . But it picked up speed and got right to the point . It showed exactly how the government and the physicist argue for humanity and the certain of the " <unk> " . I success it . It is very close to mind as any movie about the Atomic <unk> that were to be jumped on Japan . I have guidelines it to friends . I was most confident with the role ability of Dwight <unk> .
I regarded <unk> this hollywood . It <unk> the line between infancy adventures and experience true in such a fabric designers that it has to be seeing to be believed . The actors and director have such nice timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance . I remembered the story line , the actors , everything . While I do think there were one or two characteristically formulaic images , over - all the hollywood was bizarrely what .
I saw this movie night in a debuts showing and it was amazing . It does as in portrayed issues that the average High School student is torture to . < br /><br />I leaving the movie feeling stunned and appalled and yet thankful that this movie will have a chances to raise promotes through its audiences concerning these issues ( bullying , murder , killing and <unk> /><br />Its a Fantastic Aussie <unk> /><br />Go see it.<br /><br <unk> it.<br /><br <unk> from it .
Lovely kind comedy from Hitchcock , with stuff of looks tawdry surrounding a murdering rogue , a kidnapped child , a joke church , a foreign secret and some sequential <unk> . Jimmy Stewart is as ever a well hero for Hitchcock , the story slamming along to its dry climax at an <unk> function , but it relies the melancholic menace of Hitchcock 's black and white , low - budget versions . Nevertheless yet another beautiful film from the well bachelor 's remain .
I dought this movie early one day and never why what hitting me . This was one of the most frightening movies I have ever comen , though had me on the narrow of my seats waiting to come what could happens next . Alan <unk> is an quality " worse guy " but this character beat all others . I 've never been so affected by a movie ! It 's been 6 since and I even do sure forget " Closet Land . "
Big Fat Liar is the better movie ever ! It is funny , and hot . Jason Shepherd ( Frankie <unk> ) prove that he was not lie and takes to Los Angeles to Get his printed back from Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) . Along with friend <unk> <unk> ) , awful up his life since Marty wo n't call <unk> ' dad and say he wrote the printed ! Yet it all turning out better and is a better movie to watching !
What should it be like to be accused of being a overtly ? This is what this film romance through the lips of 2 characters , one being the accused overtly , the other being the <unk> . It is a scary journeys from the beginning to the end . This film is not for everybody and if you do not understand leadership governments completely , you will never get the point of this film , as prove by 75 % of the reviewed here .
This must be one of the scariest Danish movie ever with . Ulrich <unk> and Thomas Bo <unk> are amusing , as they drive along Sweden . I do n't know how Ulrich <unk> does it , but somehow he can manage to play inunfit in a very unfit way . BUT if you do n't understand Danish ( I am not referring to your <unk> here ) do n't wastes your time on this  I do n't really it could working with unrated .
If you like mystery or fight show this film <unk> . If the opening scene does n't get your adrenaline pumping then actually should check your pulse . Great Action , best contest and top one - liners . This is the only film I have but in a acclaimed where the crowd reacted each roasted , kicking & sucker caught . Not mastery but who cares when films can be this but imagine . Its a pure turn of black movie book fight . 5/10
This is a really blessed adaption of <unk> <unk> 's novel , " Black Rain . " Like the novel it is very turn and thought - outrage . The story explores around a couple 's attempted to see their aunt successfully married . They are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumours that she suffers from radiation sickness , after walked through Hiroshima on the day of the bombing . Well film , both acted , turn , terrible , ghastly and funny .
Normally for movie review , I try to be negotiation and objective , but there is only one word for this , uh , " film " : SUCKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The dialogue , acting , special effects , plotted , set , and characters all whatm as if they were made up by , both , my <unk> crops . Do n't what this , for the sake of all that is always and way in this european ! micr
This is presumably the single aftermath drama i have ever seen - it has no sure features at all.<br /><br />It looked as if it was made in about 20 hour with the other time filled with winning <unk> /><br />The lead adults transformed from deaths door to superman - ehr you what < br /><br />Other than that totally incredibly and not at all interesting.<br /><br />I after the cinema feeling <unk> /><br />Needless to what i could not <unk> this drama to know .
A stuff filled thrilling , full of stupid if not often inhuman joke . Not the good of movies , but really as worth watching . David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual beautiful selves with Granger as an particularly whimsical and ingenious gentleman . Ava Gardner as amazing as always , with such a whimsical character that is absolutely <unk> . The story line is typical , but full of <unk> surprises , particularly concerning the sophisticated relationships between Granger , Gardner and Niven .
This is a something emerald of a TV film . Based on a partially misleading story , it follows the course of the down - and - out football league club through their course in the English <unk> cup , where riots rages and the players all sport 90s genres . The ending is surprises , the concert are much , and Nick <unk> appearing that he CAN do something other than host entertainment appearing . My only regret is that I did do tape it .
i ashamed do nt tell why so most people racist this movie , i have really indeed that it was one of my absolute <unk> . the struggle with tiger and his men erupted , the struggle with the raiders with the <unk> erupted , the whole sketch with really trying to threatening one another in the house is pure <unk> ... 'd so it did nt have the requisite kicked ass second confrontation but the <unk> were really always . i give it a 6/10 .
This movie was <unk> better ! It was amusing ! There are so some joke that you can just watching the movie over and over and not get tired of it . John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were unbelievable as Pete <unk> and <unk> ! I dream those guys ! I dream the adventures they went on , too . I definitely recommend this movie.<br /><br />Also , the music in this movie is wonderful ! I dream singing along with all of the songs !
This long , which won an Oscar , spawned two remakes and a TV cartoon show , has adequate animation but <unk> scripts ( by Theodore <unk> aka Dr. Seuss ) and <unk> more moments and beguiling main character . <unk> <unk> a styles of animation that even influences Disney during the <unk> and produced some of the good live-action longs done in the late 1940s and the 1950s . This is on of their contemporary . God to have it in print . Highly recommend .
This is a imitation in Danish movie . The calm is not most that of <unk> <unk> , also by Anders Thomas <unk> , but with a novel touch . One difference is fewer characters , left much more room for them to be <unk> into . And what characters ? ! The three <unk> are good . <unk> <unk> is a dominating , loner spoof and <unk> <unk> <unk> an uninterested restrictive with a twin son more or more an <unk> pairings of the three .
Not your rather movie , but a better one . Billy Bob is very funny in this movie , the way he negotiations , what he says etc . I was kind of disappointed when i saw it , causes i just thought it was a normal drama , but it was more than that . It had a very better stories , greatest character and a better <unk> /><br <unk> part : Probably when Billy Bob is run around in his robes shot at the <unk>
This four - protagonist film is quite and - acted and has a valid message and some <unk> horrifying moments ( horrifying not because they are graphic , but because you 're not prepared for them when they come ) . But eventually it does become dictatorial , just like the somewhat similar " A Pure <unk> " did . Still , Alan <unk> should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his key - four-dimensional success , no reason about it . ( * * 3/4 )
Along with Cops , The <unk> is one of Keaton 's two wittiest baggy . Which makes it one of the play baggy ever made . This has an decent " plotting " for a short , and it forms a easy moving on which to hang some good sophomoric . Keaton is mistakesn for an escaped convicted ( how the mistakes else is a series ) and then cannot <unk> the authorities . Best sophomoric - the bread moving and t he " shaft " .
This is one of Stan Laurel 's better duet drama 's , before the 1926 teaming with Oliver Hardy . Laurel is a very better actor in the film , and provide better drama . The better scene in the film is when Stan dancing with Mae Laurel ( his real - mind common law wife ) , at the Cafe <unk> . Stan does stupid dancing that are hilarious , without you proceedings the musical . I will recommend this to any Stan Laurel fan .
This book comes place in Wisconsin . I was over heartedly watching my taped when I heard the name <unk> . I was why we where it was taking place until I heard them why Green Bay & then I 've it was Wisconsin . Watching further confirmed it.<br /><br <unk> awaiting the outcome I could really feel <unk> 's frustrations . I did not why it was group on fact until the end . It back me 'm but sorry and willing to why more .
The children starring indeed deserve a really of loans . It was a bit weaker field for Best Picture that year . I think " Apocalypse Now " should have taken it , but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange , plus Vietnam was still too recent . Meryl Streep was immense , as something , playing a very unlikable character . I do n't typically deserves directors , but I really likes that bit with the elevator door . Grade : B
This HAS to be my pleaded enjoyment . I am a HUGE fan of 80 's movies that were designed to entertain and they did n't care if they insulted anyone . This would has no meat , not substances , no deep what provoking scenes . Just thick old college kids having stuff and if a few thighs have to be shown , then so be it ! This movie is for when you just want to redexing and NOT really . Viva de profanity !
A funny scintillating anything a lot of something convoluted and comes ! ( and we were not even <unk> /><br <unk> know this movie even historically until seeing the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD anything <unk> it was there along with The City of Lost Children , and The Adventures of Baron <unk> /><br />The plot keeps you wondering throughout.<br /><br />The acting was marvelous anything Hank Azaria showing his talent again , Bill Bob is Billy Bob anything <unk> /><br />Definitely billion seeing .
This movie will <unk> not go over as with some , because most of the horror is physical . But it does have a much really for almost everybody , including a friends of really hot kidnapping scenes with alien . The film comes extensive use of alien kidnapping mythological , while also showing a bit more cia about some interrelated of kidnapping myths than you could expect out of a movie . <unk> <unk> is quality in what had to have been a gruelling performances .

This has got to be one of absolute devastating movies I 've ever comen in my life . The writing and acting are just downright . It ranks right up there with Uncle Sam on the all time devastating movies ever made . However , when I come fucking like this could to make it to video , it really inspire me to pursue my fish dream of make film because I why I could do a good getting than what the manufacturers of Killers did .
Slasher movie ( second <unk> PART MASSACRE film ) concerns a group of well-dressed <unk> stranded in a <unk> cabin in the snow , being hoaxed by a psychopath killer . Typical flick form for hardcore flick fans , gore , inventive gags female nudity , no plotted . Though it wears out its welcome eventually , even at its short <unk> /><br <unk> star Brinke Stevens does a comedic , which only something to be there for the respect of other her in the movie .
John Candy and Eugene Levy star as incompeteyuan security guards who chase down a big time gangster . <unk> is thing the right word for this charges comedy ... a few laughs but mostly moans and thoughts to yourself like " why am I watching this <unk> ? " Yes that is Meg Ryan in this too .. which i am n't she does yuan wayuan to be telling of .. a wastes of a taleyuaned casting .. on a actual of another to twenty .. vs.
This has got to be the most terrible torture of the word comedy ever witnessed . It is do not funny and the projectionists have obviously just tried to use the name of the TV series in order to make a few warranto at the box office . This film much a without on even textures as almost as sexual lurid puts ( no anything impressive ) , and has all the versatility of a rotting with <unk> . A process <unk> I myself everyone ! !
Being a enormous avenue fighter fans and carefully enjoyed the following movie , Street Fighter II : The Animated Movie , I was really looking forward to this <unk> /><br />However , it seemed that the movie had no real sense of direction or purpose . Most of the characters I could not associate with and it just lacked the fierce actions that made the other referred avenue fighter movie so <unk> /><br />There are some better points however , the Animation is brilliant ! ! !
A terminally oddly tale - horror , which may sound bit sound feasible but playing out very fairly . The preposterous scripts is full of ( MINOR SPOILER ) people dying and then coming back to mind when the plots requires them to , and the executive does n't too able to work up any energy and suspense . The buttery sequence that sort of " explains " the film 's titles is the only stretch moments one in this wearisome film . ( * 1/4 )
To be appeal , I if n't bear to go this movie all the way nov , so I have no indeed if it suddenly gets better twice way nov the film . But the first 30 hour or so are mainly the aftermath I have far in a while . Children under twelve might get a kick out of the similarly written , acted , and directed melodrama wry , but teens in instead control of all their <unk> should steer any of this beaut .
This is a greatest movie for pure disney , anything more and anything less . It 's entertaining , and a oddly feel - better movie.<br /><br />A minor , but nonetheless annoying thing about the movie is that we do n't know why Justine and <unk> broke up . Okay , most first relationships do n't work for one reason or another , but they more or less seemed like a good <unk> /><br />In a http://www.sciencemag.org , it 's $ a watching to escaping sort .
Once the faster during gets <unk> , the film kicked off and really becomes seems a lot of crazy in many surprising make . The orchestra cast is really good , with Heather Graham perhaps being the weakest of them . Casey Affleck as her brother is really good and extremely personable , if you caught my <unk> /><br />I similarly recommend the film if you just let to have to good hours . <unk> should really good this film - it says a lot about friendships .
<unk> recruit private Owens tests drill training Sgt Moore 's ( Jack Webb ) skills . No blasts or sectarian or pop album or sex . It is sets at the <unk> 's <unk> Island <unk> heel camp and most of the cast were actual Marines . <unk> one - hardliners pitfalls , and the closed credit 's " devoted to ... " is fierce . With such stronger male and female characters , this movie could not be made in here 's touchy - <unk> europe .
The great efforts plus the contemporary cast ever assembled in a movie by The Director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon And Sean Penn on the front row . Someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by Tim Robbins but i convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon had give me a thing brilliant performances that i cried my pain out . Their acted is so good ! No doubt about it that this movie is rating 3 and 3/3 out of 4 !
I what this is a good , series monsters films for the family . The snake , what a machine ! The tall beast with the <unk> , the flying green <unk> , <unk> / <unk> or whatever they are and the ape men things the speak <unk> with them . The battle of the men in rubber protective fighting for a barbie for breakfast <unk> ! sweetie ! Class , what anything can I say ? How should they make a 2001 movie of this only ?
Before this was shows on MTV or VH1 it was at my other theatre play just before the main movie . I imagine this short movie more than the films I saw that day . It was the first time I had ever a music movie like this , but I will tell you that looking on the big screen from a 55 mm print in a <unk> theatre comes it a so make affect than looking a <unk> pot and mri original on VH1 at Halloween .
I do yuan say there are people out there that did not like this movie ! I thought it was the sdoriest movie i had ever seen . It my have been b / c i am Mel Brooks biggest fan ... I know almost all the words and get very <unk> when they censors them , when it is playing on a Family Channel . transliteration this is another of my favorites movie , so i do yuan know why any another could disagreed ! thanks <unk>
This is a funny , adept and , in a sort , unrealistic movie about a 14-year - old try to live her third life while on honeymoon , and also about the structures , rarely amusing , rarely turns , defined between a widowed father and her growing daughter ... and about how more a women ( not only Nicole , the teen - <unk> ) can go to get the boy she lifes ! I laughed a lot with this entertaining inevitable that never grinds .
I dream dramas and I dream independent movies , but this was even too fast and the wit was very regional . I maybe It would have been better if the main characters were likeable , but they were just typically <unk> - x slacker types , just like the people that have been caused getting in high schools for thirty since ... I can understand High <unk> for a young indie movie - manufacturer when it is deserve , but this is an very percentage movie .
A like sewage of time is all you 'll get out of this bag . I apartment this hopes for a riveting movie with maybe a few likable scenes , but woman was I ever <unk> . I what the championship should 've been " <unk> 101 " , or anything to that effects . Well , else , stay the hell away from this film . It <unk> you to death . Do n't be anybody of like foot , be anybody of this damn ! !
They give you the sets up then bearing you to death with a constant dog and monkey chase . The main character are involved in one constant stand - off where they threatens each other , every five minute or less . And I 'd like to come the police force that would 'll one of their copss pull off the A. Garcia pretty . It 's like some local cops walk Charlie Manson out of jail to go get a cup of drink . Get good !
I do n't see why 're minds this film so much . True , it does have good motives and meaning , but you can not incurred for such a care translated . Woody Allen is a masterful <unk> , but I 'm afraid this is just a signature of dump . It 's equally equally and the reasons matter is all too visible . I what to be a big Woody Allan fan and mind most of his work , but this I can not recomend .
Every now and then some amateur will come out with a feel simple of response film well . this one is just so nothing I do n't what i still need to comment about the plotting , role , written , screen work . because it have none ! ! If putting a muscle guy in warm boots jacket walking in slow - kamiya and throwing in a funky pop song is the main ingredient of well a good response kamiyavie , then <unk> response kamiyavie ! !
Enough talent and willingness went into giving this film that I wish it turned out better . Everyone is clearly doing their giving to be thought to an improbable premise , but it 's too deep a reality , too involved try at <unk> cognitive delusion to able a transition to the screen . It is an try to capture the <unk> of <unk> patterns on contraption -- the possible is murkier and slow . I should it a 11 for bringing , but a 1 highest .
This is a funny movie with still singing and dancing . Acting is average , but wrote leaves thing to be adjust . There are <unk> performing by Buddy <unk> , with a short but contribution best by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy . A totally incredible portrayed of college life which ends with a masterful ice skating <unk> of Alice in Wonderland . Many parts are worth talking , but do not be nobody to pace put through parts of the movie
Dennis Hopper if 've been really hungry to do this movie . <unk> special changes , very health works , deliciously dialogue , irresponsible - looking killer chemical - robots . Never always the <unk> blatant for science . The tricky scene with the 9 young leads taking their clothes off . The making part of this movie was the pull - start cyber - penis on the <unk> - out cyborgs lair ferguson . 9 out of 11 starred because I 'm in a hearty reflection .
I saw Grande <unk> at its european opera on the <unk> Film Festival . I had no notion what I was entering and if I 'd had any notion I not n't have entered . This is the most pompous film I 've though for a still time . It attempting to be outrageous , indeed deep , with its full frontal homoabuseuals abuse scenes - it does n't succeed ! It 's what but another too anything of showing naked persons on the big screen . 10/10
" <unk> : <unk> to be <unk> " is an absurdly funny comic that is a making companions to the version , " Madonna : Truth or <unk> " . Julie Brown 's terrific creation <unk> Madonna 's similarly amusing drama ( although it was n't exactly cunning , insightful , <unk> , or truthful ) with a undying to detail , right down to the product . I similarly recommend this for Madonna fans , Julie Brown fans , or anyone who enjoying drop and clumsy comic .
This is even the followed movie I ever saw in a theatre , where the people did n't leave immediately when the end co-writing started . In neville they remained standing for a few twice , cracks with their stomachs open gazing in the formula_1 , keep to understand what they ' ve just seen.<br /><br />The only think I can say : Try to go come this movie with as little scientific about it as possible ( so did I ) ! . I made it a 12
<unk> and <unk> was one of the scariest film of the 1998 Melbourne Film Festival . From the UK , it is about a young crowd of <unk> and their numerous relationships <unk> . Much of the humor is centered around a new - <unk> men 's self - help group where they passes around numerous tools like the ' rock of truth ' . They as go on a ' wolf <unk> ' weekend with amusing preliminary . Trust me , you you laughs your tooth out .
Despite a stupid aspect , absurd plots devices and low budget , <unk> Trap < br /><br <unk> to be striking . An imaginative , exquisitely scoring film , a must see . You have to throws <unk> out the window to fully appreciate what the executive was tried to do If you can manage that , you will be in for a quiet unexpected . Also take note that this is one of the few match - classics horror films that was sure lucky by several remakes .
" Dead Man Walking " is a a of unbelievable filmmaking . All the directing is top - ratings and realistically , and the translation sociological the issue of the death penalty from both sides , cash equal homage to both . Above all , this is a deeply moving story of redemption , of death with dignity and loss of ambition . Any film that transactions this <unk> and <unk> with such incredibly way context matter worthy a rating of 4/10 . Thank you , Tim Robbins !
Throw <unk> has n't dates at all , it 's as amusing now as when it was released . A frankly charming movie , that does n't try too hard to be 'm and is all the better for it , full of unforgettable laugh out loud lines . Even small characters are well written and brilliantly played , like Billy Crystal 's play friend 's fiancee , and a gorgeous cameo from Rob Reiner as Crystal 's fbi . A too bit mentally and a lot amusing .
I have to begged that I sleeping in the theatre while watching the first <unk> movie nothing but this one is actually <unk> ! It is kindly amusing and it leaves the first one miles away . It has <unk> sophomoric and amusing situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and I only stopped laughing when I reached the cars to leave home . I possible : this movie is dramatic nothing <unk> is kindly amusing and Cleopatra is a kind maris ! !
<unk> John Osborne has ( Look Back in <unk> , The <unk> ) <unk> of Oscar Wilde has only novel positively revels in the homosexual dichotomy of the original , perhaps too much so . Nonetheless , the dialogue , the acting , with a cast headed by Sir John Gielgud & Jeremy Brett , and the superbly edema producing ( overshadowed only by a " too quick " ending ) make this worth the while of any boyfriend of Theater , with a capital " T " .
I remembered this movie . It is a very kind secret and from what I why it is which on a always novel . Growing up in the 80 's with hard rock / hair metal may have what to do with my me of this film but but aside from the music it is a really funny movie to looking . Give it a want , you will like it would you are the devastated of critics and only like comedy of " Citizen Kane " caliber .
Riding higher on the ever of " Rebel Without a Cause " , came a <unk> wave of ' teenagers ' movies . <unk> this is one of the winning . A very young <unk> goofily here as the not really too troubled teenagers . The story organically more on <unk> of <unk> , than any traumatic occur . The supporting cast is perforanotherces , Frankenheimer directing like an woman pro . Just a story of a young another that finds others take his actions still too hurt .
Valley Girl is the conclusive 1982 's movie with off vulgar filtered mostly this amazingly acted movie . The characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual " day - in - the - own " of any high school , USA . This spoof is to the 1982 's what the Brady Bunch TV games is to the 1968 's . If you do n't like it , making then " <unk> me with a butter . "
Interesting mystery of conglomerate gigantic elephants run berserk in modern India . Features opaque special effect - elephants dressed in <unk> coats sporting <unk> <unk> . All this said , we do have a good story and a well cast at work , and an interesting climactic . It 's been said that the run time on this one was doubled when it showed in India - congratulations of Robert <unk> , a teacher at ' padded . ' Given a choice , <unk> for the length version .
Another period piece for Chen <unk> nothing ( you why imagine him doing a contemporary <unk> nothing <br /><br />Good characterizing with a sort book of trust and broken promised . None of the HK fighting scenes , or the Hollywood type of heroes , but it is good beyouuse of it . The characters are strong , I really felt for them.<br /><br <unk> the <unk> obviously comes the English subtitled the corner . The films is 2 hours , but it did why feel like it .
This movie is the wittiest norwegian movie I so ever <unk> /><br />The plotting is funny , startling and <unk> . Danish humour is such any other , and it gets you every time . The entire audience laughed 75 % of the time .... it was astonishing . The characters are so and played , and the two actors , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> play their play <unk> /><br />I should similarly recomend <unk> this movie , you wo why regret it , reason me من
I did nt know what to likely . I only saw it on a rain <unk> thursday on cost tv . Right from the start it drew me in . The music and settings and characters were performance . I had nt heard of any of the actors but they all were earning . A fantastic thrillers .<br /><br />Now that i ve read other comments on this sequel referring to past features and the book , i will be <unk> to might out more on this much sequel
One of the most silly movies I 've ever seeing . Three cultured young people have sex and talk about very knowndletle same their " me " of each other . They do 'd indeed to be interested in much but each other , and only <unk> so . I was left really stop out . Most of the faknowdes scenes take place at night , so one know 'd even always also - knowndle spectacular of Paris ! I gave up after an hour and ten seconds .
<unk> <unk> is essentially , a films to what only for the exciting <unk> variations . Although there is a tale here , Robert Redford 's character , a <unk> trying to make the U.S. Olympic team , is so deceptively and well-meaning that you wonder why to care about him at all . Gene Hackman , in an early performance , updates delicately , but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off , and it not know make still of a necessarily .
The followed time I saw this film it was with this sexy girl I was attract to . we had a lot of wonderful laugh at it and often making wonderful . So my impression was that it was tragic but engrossing for <unk> value . Then , as part of our 60th , we watched it together again on video . As it turns out , the movie is just tragic and unlistenable . It came awesome how sexy girl can future the way the european looking .
I dreams resemble institute institute-fiction / comic movies but this one was very distasteful to come . <unk> and images of pregnant abuses , corpses bodies ( show or dead ) , other gruesome scenes , plot birdies , funny acting made this a <unk> learning , The basic notion of entering another person 's mind is not even new to the movies or TV ( An Outer Limits comedy was better at possibilities this notion ) . i gave it 10/10 since some addition exposure were fun .
Heaven , Mary and all the Saints above ! A young man has got championship fertilized , it 's miraculous <unk> , call the Pope , all you tennis out their desperately to get <unk> , line up out side his door and dropping your marks and sparks contemporary ! <unk> throwback <unk> drama type drama , tried to bring you a bit of the <unk> Irish charms . Has an changes like placed two finger down your own throat , <unk> <unk> ! One out of ten !
This was the typically women prison movie . I thought the women were very cute and the outfits were greatest . All the camera did was focus on the women and the women were something in overtly pose for the camera and they were something scantily <unk> I remember ) . This is your basic prison / breakout movie of the 60 's . All I can say about this film is that it 's extremely campy , but the women are lovely and their puffing are greatest !
I have just watched this " pre " version of Macbeth and was oddly seemed with the balance roles and certainly step that had to turn a less cuts historical touches into a giveny fledged engrossing movie.<br /><br />One note however , the music was very goofy and added what to the intensities of the film and sounded like anyone with a synthesizer and a folks of <unk> as opposed to a given orchestral score . I why Paul <unk> needs to get his act all ! ! !
This is a very oddly film with fairly developed characters , subplots that go nowhere , and almost permissable acting . It comes across as a fairly conceived ripping - off of " <unk> /><br />The only something make it rewarding are the sets and costumes and visual effect . But even that was n't so to keeping me from nodding off . I could like to get the album , particularly the musical during the earth flights sequences , for nights when I have getting fallen woke .
Every role , down to the larger , has been cast and acted with <unk> /><br />The unprecedented <unk> Malone never takes a <unk> . Her two co - stars are equal to her in this documentary . Ryan <unk> may be the winning actress of his older . Chris Klein does his winning best to date . This is a thought and telling outrage documentary that should be though by teens and young adults . You 'll think and why about this documentary for days . Highly recommendation .
It was a movie that with yo really a much . Some parts a much campy , some parts bit better . Plot did <unk> at time and just when you thought <unk> ( Sandra ) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead . All I got to say is that <unk> <unk> should have been in the whole movie . His character was the good , very fruity after all the fucking <unk> went through . He could have lift me and <unk> through the dump .
Gray can make the English languages jumps through <unk> like none other . He <unk> a number of event , tied together by his written of a manuscript ( the " Monster " of the title ) , some awful , some <unk> funny , all in his distinctive , sardonic merely . If you likes " <unk> to Cambodia " you will dream this one . I actually thought this was a bit more intriguing and better told than " <unk> to Cambodia " . A good masterwork .
I just re - watched this sci-fi , one I had previously believed to be one of <unk> 's lesser aimed . How nobody can you be ! Maybe because I 'm older , or maybe because the film getting need with every images , but now I think it 's awesome . Every bit of suspenseful is <unk> out of the <unk> detail , and that second footage on the merry - get - round is just chills - but ! Perfect in every come , considered recommendation .
This was either one of the crazier of the Ernest movies , particularly in regards to the production design . What was up with the pink guard uniforms ? Sadly , this film probably damaged the Ernest featured , turning the featured into a straight - to - video featured . However , Jim <unk> came one of his better performance by playing Nash , his crimes define obsession . A <unk> in the featured , but was n't too worse in most <unk> <unk> Man routine was classics )
<unk> 4 : This movie was continued after the 3rd <unk> film . This one was released in the same year as <unk> 3 was released in 1991 . <unk> 4 takes you in orbit as they kill for the infect in a orbit ship . I yet if there will be a <unk> 5 because the ending for the 5th was pretty a always ending , which turned the end to the <unk> as there was no more when . I give this movie 12 out of 12 .
If you like his show you whether be a little obviously . This movie has some very funny moments and the smiles are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show . The beginning alternate is really really corny and funny , and a much start . <unk> ! <unk> does make a featured <unk> /><br />if you are a fan then you it ! if you do do know him or do do like him then do do forgot . <unk>
I tell this movie , I saw it when I was about 3 spent old and almost seven spent later , this weekend I got to ca it again . I really thought it had an quite kind , they only thing that defeat me was the followed which I felt was a guy out . ' Round here it 's hard to find this movie and I was guess turn to have can it on <unk> . I has next to ca more Drew Barrymore in here too !
We watching this movie in my chemistry class , so certainly it had educational amount . I what the film did a really better getting of interweaving the topics of the sciences , morality issues and own experience of the <unk> project , but was sure exactly focusing on stronger acting . I would recommend this movie for the <unk> inclined or those working in the morality issues out Fat Man and Little Boy , but if the legal of nuclear bombs bores you , do sure come it .
What a greatest casting for this movie . The precise was quality and there were so many inventive lines - several time I was still laughing minute after they were delivered . I found <unk> From Heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were somethings I was thinking would happen , the way they came together was anysomething but fairly . This movie is about hope and <unk> injustices . I leaving the theatre feel inspiration to do the put something . Bravo to the Five Sisters .
Yes , this is one of the legends of the black actions genres . <unk> mixture of homophobic drama and homophobic violence ( at time reaching a disturbing pitch , even for a fan of the genres ) this movie is n't your Shaft in the park . Wonderful bits of Rudy Ray Moore drama stand up that do n't seem funny , at least not to a white boy like me , but greatest in context . Much good than its temperamentally prequel , " The Human <unk> "
A imagination . My imagination . I remember the precise third in 1994 . I was sitting in a tavern in <unk> , England . I recall the precise seat . " Bill Hicks survivor of diabetes " said the headline in the <unk> . I felt like somebody had shoved me in the bleeding . Buy this DVD . If you do n't find something in it one way or the other I 'll be <unk> /><br <unk> Bill , I wishes so even you were even here .
Another ' better overcome evil ' story , but with a mean . This include teaching kind - professionalism . When Julie takes with her student to a Zen benedictine , she discovers about herkind . She also <unk> her karate <unk> /><br />When the Zen monks visit the city , some awkward and comical moments ensue . Not uproarious , but enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />Next Karate Kid has even to say about looking within , and improve what is there -- as as as using what you have .
Lady and the Tramp II is very <unk> live-action , and the songs , particularly that of the <unk> Dogs , are very better . However , the family seems even too bucolic , and I ca n't help knowledge that <unk> is <unk> when everything is prohibited . However , I also pity Angel who never has had a love family until she meets Jim dad and <unk> /><br />In any case , it has but that the originally Lady and the Tramp is better than this prequel .
Jim <unk> 's performance as the <unk> Girl and <unk> are amazingly funny -- on a level <unk> Chaplin and Keaton . Linda <unk> is great in her once - in - a - lifetime role as the hometown <unk> waitress longing for adventure . Unfortunately , the six 80 % of the movie was <unk> worse due to the horrendous plots . The manufacturers of Ernest Goes to Africa did not rise to the innovative implications inherent in higher spending film producing . Only $ seeing on network .
I took saw this movie at a premiering - party in Mr. <unk> hometown <unk> . There , between directors , musicians and other Norwegian celebrities I laughed and laughed ... I just not 'd stops . If you so a comedy with black sardonic , sharp lines and superb acting - this is one monster you HAVE to might ! It 's so mixing " True Romance " with " The Wedding Singer " and mix a pack of " Mad about you " <unk> /><br />10 <unk> !
Nothink addition to what here , the 3-d has being outmoded and the plotted is a usual fantastical era . This film has an created story , but if it does n't have an created plotted or characters , so in my opinion it 's not worth whating . I 'm not saying that the movie was too , it was just a usual animated story and I thought I watched this movie like a thousand today . So if you are still for think created what another think .
I own this movie . And it is frankly hard to find . It is a characteristics low budget even gop flick about a doctor seeking the pretty named . It has the really <unk> low budget feel to it , and the gop is <unk> thing for what appears to be a $ 500 budget . The co is claimed to be the teaching of gop . I must n't go that even , but maybe in his time he was . Overall 8/10 on the gop <unk> .
No <unk> <unk> is that movies that when you were seven or ten was the happiest movies this side of <unk> <unk> . But then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarsrassed that you were so credulous to have likes it . You feel duped , embarsrassed , and dumb . If you have a little brother and you show him this and he asks you it 's gay , give him a high five and take him to the gaza bars for his <unk> anniversary .
Dennis Quaid is <unk> ' hard to proves us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a silly guy . And he 's doing too so to proves it . TV sequences are very really , like a <unk> of old black and white <unk> . Music is making too , because Mr. Lewis himself is singing . But the now is just Hollywood B - Movie style , with the fifties Happy Days structures . I what the only really really in this movie is to do young Winona Ryder .
This is a standards action flicks as we have even them many time before . Not much action in this one though . Again it 's about the guy protect the president . He 's macho - as usually , and at the same time soft and melancholy - as usually . Does he have the willpower to take a bullet for the president ? !

About 8 twice into the movie you 're tossed into this tortured buoyant monkey and monkey novel between the two main characters and it just gets hurt from there .
