What a script , what a story , what a mess !
More suspenseful , more subtle , much , much more disturbing ....
Just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - Veidt & Barrymore
This is a great movie . Too bad it is not available on home video .
a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention ... Ben Daniels is fascinating ( and courageous ) to watch .
This is a good film . This is very funny . Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films !
Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars . It is < br /><br <unk> , funny , and endearing
For pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the <unk> films . I highly recommend each and every one of them .
Absolutely fantastic ! Whatever I say would n't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves . Watch it now ! <unk> !
This is the greatest movie ever . If you have written it off with out ever seeing it . You must give it a second try .
If you like <unk> Shore , you 'll love Son in Law . If you hate <unk> Shore , then , well ... I liked it !
Without a doubt , one of Tobe <unk> 's best ! <unk> <unk> , great special effects , and The <unk> ( vamp me baby ! ) .
Brilliant . <unk> along with Citizen Kane , The Matrix and <unk> . Must see , at least for <unk> in her early days . Watch it .
Widow hires a psychopath as a <unk> . <unk> film noir thriller which does n't make much of its tension promising set - up . ( 3/10 )
Anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside & <unk> a couple . Great story.<br /><br <unk> is for people who ca n't handle drugs .
The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from Gary Busey . Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job .
I caught this film late at night on HBO . Talk about wooden acting , unbelievable plot , et al . Very little going in its favor . Skip it .
This movie was so incredibly boring , Michael J. Fox could 've done so much better . Sorry , but it 's true for all you people who liked the movie
Very intelligent language usage of Ali , which you <unk> miss ! In one word : ( <unk> sentence ... ) Wicked , so keep it real and pass it on !
My first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women , <unk> not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending
The plot was really weak and confused . This is a true Oprah flick . ( In Oprah 's world , all men are evil and all women are victims . )
This movie turned out to be better than I had expected it to be . Some parts were pretty funny . It was nice to have a movie with a new plot .
The one - liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones . By far one of the best of this genre .
... an incomprehensible script ( when it should n't have been ) dependent on a rather <unk> voice - over.<br /><br />The animation , however , show real talent.<br /><br />Quite visually impressive .
Complete entertainment ! Although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself does n't have them including the autumn characters ( mother and daughter ) the general concept rocks .
You may like Tim Burton 's fantasies , but not in a commercial - like show off lasting 8 minutes . It demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace .
This movie is based on the novel Island of <unk> . Moreau By H.G. Wells . It 's a fairly good one too , it 's at least better than the version by John Frankenheimer .
I do n't believe it ... Luc <unk> is not only a genius now ... he has always been one ... this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films ... just perfect !
1st watched <unk> - ( Dir - Tim Robbins ) : Very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty . <unk> more recognition and publicity than it received .
John Leguizamo 's " <unk> " is one of the funniest one - man shows I 've ever seen ! I recommend it to anyone ! Well , anyone with a good sense of humor ....
<unk> Matter : <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Stephen <unk> < br /><br <unk> : Phillip Glass < br /><br <unk> I died and gone to Heaven ? < br /><br />You will be <unk> .
I 've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie . Bad characters , bad story and bad acting . It would be a love story between a man and a mermaid . Really awful .
i really wanted this to be good as i am from Liverpool where it is set but it truly awful . the acting from everyone involved is <unk> the script is terrible <unk> terrible . terrible
Well , this movie actually did have one redeeming quality . It made up the funniest season one episode of <unk> I wish <unk> had released this one instead of " The <unk> Hand . "
In my opinion this is the best Oliver Stone flick -- probably more because of <unk> 's influence than anything else . <unk> stuff -- full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending .
The Claude Lelouch 's movie is a pretty good moment of cinema . One of the most touching films about family and loneliness , and surely the best interpretation of French actor Jean - Paul Belmondo .
A really realistic , sensible movie by Ramgopal Verma . No stupidity like songs as in other Hindi movies . Class acting by Nana Patekar . < br /><br />Much similarities to real ' encounters ' .
<unk> " Boy 's Own Paper " nonsense with a <unk> performance from Cushing , some amusing rubber monsters , colourful jungle sets , & the ever - welcome appearance of Caroline Munro in animal <unk> .
Excellent documentary that still manages to shock and enlighten . Unfortunately , times have n't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom - conscious Americans to see .
Leslie <unk> is a very talented actor , who made a huge mistake by doing this film . It does n't even come close to being funny . The best word to describe it is STUPID !
This movie is a real waste of time and effort . The film lacks plot and depth . The visuals are decent but nothing to write home about . There are far better films out there .
The movie is not that bad , Ringo Lam sucks . I hate when Van Damme has love in his movies , van Damme is good only when he does n't have love in his movies .
If it was n't for the terrific music , I would not hesitate to give this cinematic <unk> 2/10 . But the music actually makes me like certain passages , and so I give it 5/10 .
It 's not Citizen Kane , but it does deliver . <unk> , and lots of it.<br /><br <unk> acted and directed , poorly scripted . Who cares ? I did n't watch it for the dialog .
Wonderful songs , <unk> animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale . A nice British feel which sets it apart and above from the standard , saccharine sweet Disney cartoons .
This movie is so bad it 's almost good . Bad story , bad acting , bad music , you name it . O.K. , who are the <unk> that gave this flick a ' 10 ' ?
Why this worthless piece of French cinema has garnered any sort of attention , other than negative , is beyond me.<br /><br />Don't bother renting this one . It should n't have even come into this country .
i m sure he does nt need the money for a life saving operation or transplant . in all honesty i think this review qualifies as a better movie than ' <unk> ' . thanks for listening .
I do n't know why I even watched this film . I think it was because I liked the idea of the scenery and was hoping the film would be as good . Very boring and pointless .
Best club scenes that i have seen in a long time - atmosphere mesmerising - <unk> Rhys 's performance is impeccable and <unk> . i would recommend this film to any age group . watch out for <unk> !
I smiled through the whole film . The music is great . The story - telling is great . It 's a wonderful film . This picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties .
<unk> can to some people look a bit long but it 's one of rare real <unk> adventure film . It could be compare to <unk> <unk> with a bit of <unk> <unk> . You must see it .
Albert Pyun delivers a very good action / drama about a junkie who tries to rip - off a big crime - lord . A lot of style and many very cool actors . Burt <unk> is excellent .
Worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is <unk> but you have to see it really ! ! ! ! <unk> watch the <unk>
Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris are touching . This movie is really surprising . It was enjoyable from start to finish.<br /><br />The story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football <unk> /><br / >
Worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is <unk> but you have to see it really ! ! ! ! <unk> watch the <unk>
I found this movie really hard to sit through , my attention kept wandering off the tv . As far as romantic movies go .. this one is the worst I 've seen . Do n't bother with it .
This film contain far too much meaningless violence . Too much shooting and blood . The acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor . The only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars .
I thought this movie was horrible . I was bored and had to use all the self control I have to not scream at the screen . <unk> Squad was beyond cheesy , beyond cliche , and utterly predictable .
Pointless movie about making a movie . No where near the flesh shown in the original , which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music . Not here.<br /><br />It 's always fun seeing the <unk> guy though .
From a military historian 's standpoint , nearly everything in this movie is historically accurate . Beyond that , it is an enthralling story that leaves you depressed at the end but quite glad you took the time to watch .
A quite easy to watch tale of 2 thieves , with that love / hate type relationship between them . <unk> Walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than he 's letting on .
Yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame . Real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as <unk> war and <unk> are unreal . A moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making .
<unk> : <unk> error < br /><br />When Charlie walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a <unk> . After a few seconds we hear a loud bang from the same gun being fired .
Its the best movie I have seen in 2000 , it has the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman in it . It has a great storyline , cast and soundtrack . I enjoyed it very much . 10 out of 10
In my opinion , this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography . Too bad the story is not all that good and Mr. Cage sometimes loses his accent . But two thumbs up for lighting and the DP !
I have seen " Chasing the Dragon " several times and have enjoyed it each time . The acting was superb . This movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life .
Robert Carlyle excels again . The period was captured well and the soundtrack , although hearing modern techno in this period piece was a little disconcerting at first , proved to be very well <unk> /><br />Well worth a watch .
This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The only advantage seeing this movie is that the next movie ca n't possibly be worse . It 's childish as hell ( but Children are n't allowed )
Hartley on low - key form : Martin Donovan , born to play Jesus , comes as Messiah to <unk> <unk> ; P.J. Harvey is excellent as sidekick <unk> . A slight film , but <unk> amusing , short and sweet .
When the Italians and Miles <unk> work together nothing can go wrong ! As ever , Miles is great as the almost as great <unk> ; the most lovable <unk> of all times . Totally lives up to the first movie .
I do n't care if some people voted this movie to be bad . If you want the Truth this is a Very Good Movie ! It has every thing a movie should have . You really should Get this one .
Blondell & Farrell are excellent . Blondell was <unk> . This was very funny and I laughed often throughout it . Great dialogue and its loaded with wisecracks . I could 've watched it for hours . <unk> fun to watch .
One of those TV films you saw in the seventies that scared the hell out of you when you were a kid but still gives you an eerie feeling . No great actors or expensive production but <unk> that phone rings ......
The screen - play is very bad , but there are some action sequences that i really liked . I think the image is good , better than other <unk> movies . I liked also how the actors did their jobs .
Beautiful coming of age romance about an English boy and French girl who run off , and grow up.<br /><br />I saw this movie as a teenager and loved it . I saw it again this year and loved again.<br /><br / >
amazing movie . Some of the script writing could have been better ( some cliched language ) . Joyce 's " The Dead " is alluded to throughout the movie . Beautiful scenery and great acting . Very poetic . Highly recommend .
The distribution was good , the subject could have been <unk> and comic . whereas , he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving <unk> . Instead of this , the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy .
Young <unk> fake accent was difficult to accept at times.<br /><br />The show was billed as mystery / <unk> but should have been listed as a romance.<br /><br />Don't rent this one if you are sleepy , it will knock you out .
To anyone who likes the TV series : forget the movie . The jokes are bad and some topics are much too sensitive to laugh about it.<br /><br />We have seen much better acting by R. <unk> in " <unk> 8 " .
A wonderful story about the consequences of obsessive love with the beautiful romantic back streets of Paris as its location . We 're transported through time and see the plot develop from the perspectives of the three main characters as the mystery <unk> .
I 've seen several of these body <unk> type movies , but none was nearly as bad as this one.<br /><br />No thrill , no FX , bad acting , bad photography , bad sound , bad everything.<br /><br <unk> <unk> <unk> all !
I ca n't believe this movie has an average rating of 7.0 ! It is a <unk> bad movie , and I saw it when it was fairly new , and I was in the age group that is supposed to like it !
Me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day , we picked one each and one of us picked <unk> . Lets just say that from now on , we never let him pick a movie . This movie sucks
What a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco in this exciting action picture . Although the characters and the story are in fact bad , it still has a certain cult - flair .
< br /><br <unk> is simply David Cronenberg 's best movie . All the people compare it to the Matrix . They 're not even similar . If you enjoyed Cronenberg 's other works just a little bit , you 'll love this one ...
The <unk> : A Detective Story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it . Carrie - Anne Moss plays Trinity in this animated cartoon . I really like the ' Private Detective ' ideas created by the Director .
An excellent " sleeper " of a movie about the search for Carlos the international assassin . Am surprised this film did n't <unk> in $ <unk> - plus because it 's much better than most films that do so . Rent it NOW .
Nice way to relax . I am packing my suitcase now so I can go and be with Caroline <unk> . <unk> monsters and scenery make for 89 minutes of harmless fun . Something you can enjoy with your family and not be offended .
An extremely powerful film that certainly is n't appreciated enough . It 's impossible to describe the experience of watching it . The recent UK television adaptation was shameful - too ordinary and bland . This original manages to <unk> itself in your memory .
I could nt believe how well this kid did on screen , you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie . It is like watching home movies with a twist . I recomend this to everyone . Highly .
A beautiful reflection of life 's desperation and <unk> of finding love . <unk> , while at the same time , absurdly entertaining . Most people do not give this film a <unk> <unk> just a mere reflection in itself . Until next time ...
<unk> is beautiful enough , Vanessa is beautiful enough , I liked the storyline . But I went in with the expectation to see lots of energetic hot <unk> dancing , I was disappointed . There needed to be more dancing , especially <unk> .
I was really excited when I read " The <unk> Ghost " would be shown on TV . However , I was deeply disappointed . I loved the original story written by Oscar Wilde and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie .
This is very much overrated . I guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people . It has its moments , but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow . With this cast it could have been much better .
I rented this movie to get an easy , entertained view of the history of Texas . I got a headache instead . The depiction of history in this movie is so comical that even mad TV would not have done a better job .
This movie is all about blaxploitation , there is absolutely no plot at all . A pimp stops some bad guys with his kung fu <unk> to try to get his nightclub back . Rated R for Strong Language , and a brief sexual situation .
Simply one of the best movies ever . If you wo n't get it - sorry for you . I believe that someday people will include this one in their all - time top 10 's . Not now , but in the far future .
This short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose <unk> criticism extends into his everyday life . When he learns why that 's not a good idea , we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he 's been <unk> on .
I saw this again today for the first time in about 6 years . I had forgotten how well acted this movie is . Paul Newman gets the billing , but Dwight <unk> holds his own and shows how good an actor he really is .
This is by far the best stand - up routine I have ever seen . John Leguizamo 's one man show tells the supposed story of his life in a barrage of lines and situations . By far better than any other comedy out there .
An excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone . I liked this movie because Glenn Corbett also appeared in Star Trek as <unk> <unk> in 1967 . I also liked it because I am a fan of the <unk> space program .
This was an excellent movie - fast - paced , well - written and had an intriguing plot . The special effects were innovative , especially in the opening scene . The training segment got a bit silly but overall it was a tense movie .
A story of love between two people at the end of WWII . Beautifully filmed , very romantic and yet rather fatalistic fable of budding love and war that would not end . If you want happy endings do n't watch <unk> movies , <unk> .
Another bad <unk> picture . This is very <unk> . I only save the photography and the music of José <unk> . The rest of the film is the worst I 've seen in years . Paz Vega is horrible . Do n't see it .
Independent film that would make Hollywood proud . The movie substitutes good looks for good acting , a cryptic plot for a good story line , and self - <unk> for character development . May be I missed something , go see it for yourself .
The hero John <unk> is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason . On his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and I do n't believe he got hit a single time during the movie . This is Crap .
One of the worst films of it 's genre.<br /><br />The only bright spots were Lee <unk> showing some of the sparkle she would later bring to the Time Tunnel and <unk> /><br />A young Patty Duke also <unk> the more established actors.<br /><br / >
The basic idea for this movie was good , but there was no real character development and the pacing was slow . Maybe because I saw it in a sloppily edited , <unk> video version ? ( It went straight to video in France . )
This is by far the worst non - English horror movie I 've ever seen . The acting is wooden , the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally <unk> . It 's not even scary . 2 out of 10 from me .
One of <unk> 's best movies after he had separated himself from the westerns . which in themselves were good whenever I had a chance to see any of <unk> 's earlier work I would sit in front of the set and watch whatever was on .
Nicely done evil little comedy pitting the FBI against organized crime with a nice lady caught in the middle . The actress who played the jealous wife of the mob boss ' Tony the Tiger ' almost stole the show with her raging <unk> . 3 stars
A classic 80 's movie that Disney for some reason stopped making . I watched this movie everyday when I was in like 6th grade . I found a copy myself after <unk> video stores . Well worth it though . One of my all time <unk>
When you want to celebrate life and love , especially for precious little daughters , you have to shout it from the countryside . And what gorgeous <unk> ! There are so many tears of joy even God joins in . See this movie.<br /><br / >
This is a strange , little , forgotten movie from the late eighties . It 's one of those " Large - cast kitchen sink " movies that delivers some good gags . If you like the people in this one , give it a shot .
This movie is one of the best and moving I have ever seen , because of the terrible good performance of the main actress Jennifer <unk> as Jamie Harris , who really makes you feel with her . Also the music by Mark Snow is wonderful .
One of the flat - out <unk> movies of all - time . Sim and <unk> are at their best matching wits over the predicament of an all - boys and all - girls school sharing the same quarters . <unk> has never been this sophisticated .
This movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that Crispin Glover has ever played . Uma Thurman and Suzy <unk> are also great in this movie , but Crispin makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in New York .
The Long Kiss Goodnight has just about everything action fans want : a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote Lethal Weapon , Samuel L. Jackson , and great action set pieces by Renny <unk> /><br />Seriously underrated . One of the best action movies ever .
An unbelievable plot , laughable characters , and obvious errors ( in one scene where several grass <unk> are supposed to be burning , a gas torch can be seen repeatedly trying to <unk> one of the <unk> ) , this film is a real dog .
If you have few expectations , then this will entertain for 90 minutes . My problem is that they 've dumbed down this tale for the modern audience . <unk> are already sexy , exciting characters . They <unk> need the techno soundtrack and snappy dialogue .
The script is very weak & there is no depth in the characters . The story telling is not the <unk> thing here . The unnecessary action & Scenes does not really help this one . One of the worst movies in <unk> history of films .
<unk> , pretty much all around . The only exceptions were a couple emotional scenes with <unk> ( Violet ) , with whose performance I was pleasantly surprised and occasionally moved . Beyond that , it ended up being little more than a bad <unk> flick .
The relationship between the Lone Ranger and <unk> was always good for a snicker , but to take the joke out of the joke by building a movie around the gay appeal of the legend ... oh the horror , the horror ... <br /><br / >
This film is so bad . I mean , who <unk> this stuff ? And the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983 . A bloke puts a female wig on and fights .... <unk> said .
This movie is not a remake of She 's all That ( <unk> /><br />Where is the <unk> of the american movie ? This was probably the worst movie I saw in the last 5 years . This and the last movies of <unk> /><br / >
I rented this movie because the cover was cool looking , the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting , but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring .
twenty years later , this movie still remains as entertaining as when you first watched it . In a movie market overrun by toilet humor , graphic violence and foul language , it 's refreshing to be fully entertained for two hours by such a clean movie .
While the romance in this film is an important aspect , it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern Indian . All of the major characters were well fleshed out , and had their own " inner life " . I recommend this strongly
I waited long to watch this movie . Also because I like Bruce Willis . The plot was quite different from what I had expected but still quite good . Its a good mix of emotions , humor and drama.<br /><br <unk> me thinking over and again :)
Fun movie ! Great for the kids - they found it very entertaining . Somewhat predictable , but there are a few surprises . Great movie to watch if you 're looking for something just to entertain ( do n't expect to be seeing a classic ! )
I enjoyed the movie and <unk> <unk> performance immensely . It 's the kind of movie I can show my family and has an example of a young woman placed in extraordinary circumstances finding the courage to do the right thing in the face of extreme danger .
Psycho criminal pure by Carl <unk> , who is active in Hollywood , like Mrs Soutendijk . <unk> George and <unk> <unk> are stealing the spectator 's last peace of <unk> . They are too able , how can I get calm into a lift next time ?
The essence of this film falls on judgments by police officers who , fortunately ethical and moral men , act on situations within situations in a city with a super - abundance of violence and killing . Good compound interacting story lines and above - average characterizations .
Watch out ! This is not a gross out comedy like American Pie or you know the comedies of the new <unk> . This is a sweet satire of dog shows focused on a bunch of completely different characters . Oh and the commentator is <unk> /><br />10/10
Wow ! i think they made this movie to torture people . there are no words for how much i hated this film . I could have been cleaning my room instead . i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but .... come on !
this movies is really special ! it 's about a young french who go in Barcelona ( <unk> ) in order to study and in <unk> he meets other <unk> <unk> like him . This film he 's the <unk> MOVIES of the <unk> so go watch it !
When a dowdy wife ( Shearer ) loses her husband , she decides to completely make herself over to win him back . Not " politically correct " by today 's standards , but still fun to watch , especially the scenes with Marie Dressler and <unk> Hopper .
The best horror / sci - fi movie i have ever seen . I was myself in the Arctic , working for Canadian government , in a small northern station when I see this movie for the first time ; needless to say I was in the mood ...
I know it was supposed to be a long walk , but <unk> /><br />The costumes were a bit <unk> , but still ... it was the 1970 's I <unk> /><br />It was a bit long and dull , so give me the newer version any day !
Not a film of entertainment , but of real lives & limited ambition for the working class in 60 's . Enjoyable because of my upbringing , not sure it 'd work for most people . Typical Loach . Full of TV actors / actresses of <unk> 's .
This tearful movie about a sister and her battle to save as many souls as she can is very moving . The film does well in picking up the characters and showing how Sister Helen deals with <unk> /><br />A wonderful journey from life to death.<br /><br / >
It 's dreadful , but ... < br /><br <unk> Stevens fans are given the opportunity to see the woman who inspired the lovely song " Lady <unk> " on his album " Mona Bone <unk> " , before Cat turned into a <unk> - supporting religious <unk> .
I 'm not in favor of death <unk> but in this movie , it could n't happen fast enough . Just to end the movie . I do n't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is . It fooled me into a bad night .
That 's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer 's intelligence by losing track of time , plot , and reason for being <unk> /><br />Plus , how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in Hollywood is beyond me .
The core message is strong , the cast has given it their best shot , the packaging is excellent , but the screenplay is seriously over - dramatized and every cliche in the book on women 's suffering in India has been over - used to the max .
Made it through the first half an hour and deserved a medal for getting that far . Lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time . What sounded like a good idea for a movie was badly executed .
A very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene workings of an Australian bowling club . The way they deal with various problems such as <unk> , <unk> and general running of the club , not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted .
I thought the movie was great . I thought <unk> <unk> was GREAT and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles . I even overlook the fact that the print I have was n't quite put back together correctly . But , who cares ?
Based on the true story of the <unk> hunt for those who were responsible for the bombing of the World Trade Center Building . A very good film that delves into the <unk> use of <unk> and how , possibly , the tragedy could have been avoided 7 of 10
One Crazy Summer is a fun and quirky look at love through the eyes of <unk> <unk> . what could have been hokey and dull is one of the <unk> and most energetic comedies ever . Savage Steve Holland <unk> with John Cusack to make the ultimate summer movie !
this is a great movie for all Corey <unk> fans . This movie has a great cast of young actors . a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash , but all goes wrong when a security <unk> gets shot and they take hostages
This is my favorite movie of all time . I just love all the trouble all the teams get into ! Its great . Michael J. Fox looked so young .. but then again i guess he <unk> /><br />The teams are so stereotypical you just have to laugh .
i see hundreds of student <unk> this is tops . <unk> <unk> is a fantastic <unk> he moves the camera , tells the story and uses music in a way that is far advanced for his years . no wonder he got a feature from this film.<br /><br / >
<unk> well done , but under - recognized because of limited distribution . Has big - studio feel , understands the horror genre , speeds along with clever plot twists and never stumbles . Could have been a college cult classic , if it had ever gotten the opportunity .
It 's been said before -- Strangers on a Train is Hitchcock 's best movie -- and he 's made so many good ones ! Like other Hitchcock , Strangers on a Train requires your full attention to really appreciate it , but once you can ... you will .
Hilarious film about divine retribution . Camera work stinks ( shot on digital video ) and looks like early MTV videos . Turn the other cheek by looking past the visual and concentrate on the story . <unk> galore for those with a well - developed sense of irony .
Ernest P. <unk> comes through with his third movie presentation . Jim <unk> not only plays Ernest , but doubles as the evil Mr. Nash . From start to finish this movie has some solid laughs and makes a good family film ! Rated PG for comic book violence .
Wow this <unk> took place from 3 different cities . This was the very first wrestling pay per view I ever saw and it 's a good one indeed ! There is a great steel cage match for the main event as Hulk Hogan takes on King Kong <unk> !
A great production , that should be revived / <unk> . I doubt that it would be out of date ! I 'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series , or any other information about where it could be found or viewed .
Quite a ways away from " Go Fish " . Both were good films but <unk> had a bigger budget and cast to work with here . This film was very entertaining and easy to like . The acting was good lots of slow burn sexual <unk> /><br / >
< br /><br />In the process of boring you with the <unk> , rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development , it manages to <unk> a few negative black stereotypes out there . At one point I was wondering if Jesse Helms co - wrote the screenplay .
This is the first Woody Allen film I 've found not worth watching . I think Woody has tried many different genres to interest results but this movie just left me irritated and bored . The music is lovely but do n't bother watching this hopeless mock - <unk> .
I really liked this quirky movie . The characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on TV . It has a realistic edge , with a captivating story line . The main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch .
I have seen all the film interpretations of Hamlet , from Sir Lawrence Olivier to Mel Gibson ( gasp ) . Derek Jacobi captures the true essence of the character , from the beginning to the brutal climax . Superb acting all around . This one should not be missed .
I really liked this picture , because it realistically dealt with two people in love , and one of them having a disorder . Though the ending saddened me , I know that that was the best way for it to finish off . I would <unk> this to everyone .
i am surprised so few have good words for this movie . For its time ( the 80 's ) it was a very entertaining and engaging story . Casting was good . Story was good . Special effects were remarkable for the time period . <unk> of an 8/10 .
Undoubtedly the funniest movie I have ever seen . It 's definitely worth the fourteen minutes it takes to watch . I will never look at my kitchen appliances the same way again . Bob <unk> deserves an Oscar . " <unk> , kid . It 's only a movie "
This is a great horror movie . Great Plot . And a person with a fear of midgets will definately love the evil midget ! This is a must see for any horror fan . Finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a great cast ! Highly recommended .
The club scenes in this film are extremely believable , Tim Curry is in his most <unk> mode , and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies , maybe even three . What more do you require from an evening 's entertainment ? <unk> up the volume .
This film is an excellent teaching tool as a pre - study of " To Kill a <unk> . " In <unk> with a study of the novel itself , " ... Caged Bird ... " can be used as an independent literary study or as an introduction to <unk> .
This movie is a nice , cute family oriented film . If you do n't like violence , this is the movie to watch . Only thing annoying about this movie is the tune ( but it 's a catchy tune ) repeats whenever <unk> . leaps in to action .
It is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change ! As an added bonus , it is nice to see some local home boys from Massachusetts making good in L.A. I hope this show will be a keeper .
pretty disappointing . i was expecting more of a horror / thriller -- but this seemed to be more of an episode of <unk> 's creek but with out the acting . there were some very impressive shots , though -- almost worth seeing . maybe future efforts will improve .
Honestly , buying this movie was a waste of money . It 's one of the most boring movies I have seen in my life . The only part I liked is the ending , but it 's so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie .
Fun story of a regular guy with big dreams , this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success . Great performances by Lou Myers and Brian 's neighbor , Alex . I <unk> alot and even cried a <unk> /><br / >
Seen all 4 installments , this one is by far the best of all . I <unk> have much expectation when I got the <unk> was such a drag ) , but to my delight this one was fast paced with some slick punch - lines.<br /><br />Don't miss this one .
For sheer quality of performance and the " theater of the absurd , " this one is hard to compare to anything else . With the world melting down in the early ' 70s this film made perfect sense then , and still resonates . George Scott could never be typecast .
What about DJ Cash Money ? ? ? This film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s . There was only a small mention of DJ <unk> in <unk> /><br />Also , it 's <unk> " <unk> " , not " <unk> " ! ! ! ! !
Everything I can say , is that it 's one of the best documentary movies of the ocean ever seen . It impresses immensely by professional filming , scenery and idea ! What I 've seen during those 50 minutes can not be compared to any other visions of the blue planet
This movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome . I just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it . The acting was very good , hot women and some scary parts . It is plain and simply worth the money to pay for .
This is one of the very best films i 've seen in ages ... it 's right up there with the likes of <unk> and pulp fiction . It just <unk> teenage culture today . The soundtrack is absolutely amazing ... <unk> by Pete <unk> . It 's a must see !
" Death <unk> " is a lost 70 's exploitation gem and deserves to be seen . Technically somewhat of a mess and boasting a stock of amateur New <unk> types , this film never bores . I highly recommend tracking this down . It 's a hoot and a half .
I think this movie is my favorite movie . I am not sure why , but it is . Julia <unk> has been my favorite actress for awhile , and when I saw this , I went crazy . It 's sort of romantic , and I definitely recommend this movie .
The cast was well picked . <unk> Shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together . However , <unk> Amber <unk> is who really makes this movie special . Her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see .
Although I 'm a girl , thankfully I have a sense of humor and realize that this really IS a funny anime ! Watching it does give you an overwhelming feeling that it 's definitely a guy show but that does n't take away from the fact that its hilarious ! 10/10
I did n't hate this movie as much as some on my all time black list , but I consider it a total <unk> of film . Jeremy Irons , Iron Jeremy , Ron Jeremy . Think about it . Scene one is very good , all the rest are crap .
Okay , so the movie went straight to video . If I had paid to see this , I would 've been disappointed . But , at 2 am in the morning , alone at night , it 's a pretty good fright ! ( hey , that <unk> /><br / >
this could have been good , but sadly , its too <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> has a grudge ... <unk> wanted to like it , love shark movies , someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote <unk> ! the shark is cool but the story lacks ... alot !
This movie was the <unk> and most boring so called horror that I have ever seen . I would include a comment on the plot but there was none . I do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life .
There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood ; this one is not even close to the best -- just the first . This is all production value , no substance , but the Disney name probably will help it . A good idea , a wasted opportunity .
Bronson and Ireland , in their last film together , make a likable pair . He is more restrained than usual and she has become a winning actress . But as a thriller the film is totally worthless . Its premise is downright silly and its pace is much too rushed .
<unk> 's performance is very disappointing . It seems she is trying to make up for her lack of emotion by substituting <unk> . Why the R rating includes ' sexuality ' is beyond me . There is no nudity or steamy love scenes . The plot is old and tired .
Not the funniest movie ever ..... but I have to watch this film at least once a year just so I can fall in Love with Michelle Johnson all over again . She never looked better than she did in this film . by the way The story is good too .
Nice movie and <unk> Tom does a fantastic job playing the " guy in the girl 's body " , she really does it well.<br /><br />A sort of teen version of many other movies , but well done.<br /><br />Well casted , from " Matt " to " <unk> " .
Just once in a while you see a movie so mind - numbingly awful that you have to comment on it . This was that movie . Poorly scripted , acted and totally unbelievable . It 's movies like these that show you how good the banal Hollywood trash usually is !
This movie is so awesome ! I loved it , it was really scary . I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there . It probably helped that I watched it at midnight . If you want a real scare rent this one ! 10/10
The subject of this movie is disturbing . How could some otherwise intelligent , religious , hard - working , and sincere White <unk> treat the native Blacks so <unk> for so <unk> /><br />The movie answers this question , and also explains how some <unk> are changing in a positive way .
More exciting than the Wesley Snipes film , and with better characters , too . The last vampire hunter must save Los Angeles from a coven of vampires out to conquer the city , aided by a tabloid journalist . Lost of fun ... and the names of the characters are great !
Surely the best film directed by Claude Lelouch after " <unk> <unk> <unk> " . The Jacques <unk> 's life inspiration is really present . Richard <unk> and Jean - Paul Belmondo played a really amazing duo and are really great in the psychological discovery of the two characters they are playing .
Not only is this a very interesting exploration of <unk> 's and how we react to people in our lives , it has some of the most well - filmed views of a bleak northern winter landscape . There 's nothing pretty about this film , but it stays with the viewer .
Interesting premise ; interestingly worked out ; the strongest feature of this film is the emotional tension of the astronaut who knows a truth , but is unable to convey it to others . Overlook the weaknesses and just enjoy the movie , but be prepared for a certain level of suspense .
This is a great film with an amazing cast . <unk> Glover is at his <unk> . His guitar solo is amazing . Also watch out for a cameo by William Burroughs . Truly a cult classic . This is on my top ten list . Do n't miss this twisted film .
<unk> <unk> is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the " wrong " person.<br /><br <unk> 's directing is his usual outstanding work . Although this is far from his best . <unk> is very , very beautiful . Despite the character she portrays .
... apparently Bernard <unk> ad libbed nearly all of his lines . If you can sit through the ' Daddy ! Oh my daddy " bit without <unk> then you really need to get in touch with your inner child ( trust me . I 'm a 41 year old bloke ) .
a hilariously funny movie ! of course u got ta have a sense of humour to be able to appreciate it . the music is excellent , reminded me of 50 - 60 's <unk> music which is a rarity nowadays ... worth the $ $ $ ! go check it out :)
A fine ironic visual gag takes place in front of the spectacular backdrop of a <unk> <unk> . But who are those people who rush across screen at the end : customers ? relatives ? One of the earliest <unk> in cinematic history perhaps . Well worth a minute of your time .
I have rented this film out about 6 times ! it is very well directed and the story is unique and grabs your attention from the beginning . Big up to Jason Donovan whose acting in this film was wicked and i loved the guy with the <unk> fighter moves - <unk> !
This is an extraordinary topical thriller . Fonda and Douglas are good , but Lemmon blows them away . He plays a man who must go against everything he thought was right . Bridges paces the film very well with a lot of tension . The last of the seventies expose films .
The <unk> state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines . That is the only reason I am saying anything more about <unk> . Because after all , my one line summary really says everything there is to say . There is absolutely NOTHING remotely entertaining in this film .
This movie is a pure disaster , the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen , it <unk> you incredibly . The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film . A truly , truly bad film .
No offense to anyone who saw this and liked it , but I hated it ! It dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot , also , too simple and the acting was so so ... <br /><br />I would give this <unk> a 2 at the most
Surely this deserves to be in the bottom 10 films of all time , pity it 's just a TV movie . Rubbish that only we British can produce ! It perhaps has some merit in the so awful it 's good scale . Watch out for scene where they start dancing !
This movie sucked wind . I imagine that the other 300 people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers . I ca n't imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining . I feel like 100 minutes of my life were just wasted .
This is so embarrassing . It 's a <unk> of The Wedding Singer , which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to <unk> of this film . It has the same plot , same jokes , same characters . Jeez , people need to be more original .
What a tedious turgid boring mess . This is a classic example of all that is wrong with contemporary English theater & film . About as exciting as a closet full of dirty socks . The very opposite of living film . Only the presence of Joanne <unk> gives it any spark .
Having seen just about every movie on record that a child of the eighties could have seen , this ranks at the very , very , very bottom of the heap of bad movies I have ever seen . It 's depressing and just plain , painful to watch . Nuff said .
<unk> great acting and greater Special Effects . Stars David Cronenberg , one of my personal favorites , as <unk> . It 's special effects on the monsters were so good , you thought they might be really deformed . Clive Barker , however demented , scored a perfect 10 on my list .
I 'm warning you -- this movie is not scary . If you 're a horror movie fan , especially a Child 's Play fan , you 'll think it 's incredibly funny , but you wo n't be scared . It 's not a bad movie , but it 's not scary .
For real though , this game is where it 's at . I 'm 20 years old and that 's basically where it started for me . <unk> graphics was fabulous . I hope you all remember this game with as much adoration as I do . That <unk> is a real <unk> .
Shah <unk> <unk> plays an <unk> lover who would go to any lengths to get his lady . Juhi <unk> does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny <unk> plays the hero and action man . this film is very good and i 'd <unk> it to anyone .
This was truly a heart warming movie . It is filled with so many messages . <unk> , friendship , sickness , death , and the paranoia society has concerning anything they do n't understand . I have shed a few tears during certain movies , but this movie kept the tears flowing .
The theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved <unk> is excellent . Nothing more to this film . There is a lack of good <unk> was the movie in english ? ? ) . There was lack of continuity and lack of passion / emotion in the acting .
The true story of <unk> <unk> who became a national hero in India because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner . I was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of India instead of the Bollywood art trash classics they churn out .
Non - stop action and just about every conceivable ( and inconceivable ! ) sci - fi / horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun , big - budget epic . The pace never lets up , especially in the shorter US version , which <unk> things up considerably .
How much can you really say about a condom with teeth ? The plot was really out there , but it was something campy to see on a Friday night . The story has a lot of unexpected twists , and it 's a great way to offend all you 're conservative friends !
Steve Smith has finally run a fairly weak series right into the ground with this movie . Poor actors thrashing a horrible script pretty much sums this one up . Two hours of your life you 'll never get back ! Go get a root canal instead - you 'll enjoy it more .
There must be an error . This movie belongs with " Plan 9 " , and a lot others as a quite entertaining , silly diversion . You 'll never accept you like it , yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on TV . It 's as simple as that .
This movie had terrible acting , terrible plot , and terrible choice of actors . ( Leslie Nielsen ... COME ON ! ! ! ) The one part I considered slightly funny was the battling FBI / CIA agents , but because the audience was mainly kids they did n't understand that theme .
While it was nice to see a film about older people finding each other and falling in love and the performances by Andrews and Garner were not bad , this picture poured on the <unk> and <unk> at every turn . Every curve in the plot was in view from a mile away !
When I first saw this film it was not an impressive one . Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ) , my opinion remains the same . The subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak .
The story is <unk> from the beginning until the latter third of this movie . Then the story gets more and more outrageous . The Main character portrayed by Marina <unk> is fantastic and had a difficult role . This could have been a super - great movie had the ending been more realistic .
I saw this movie when it aired on the WB and fell in love with Riley Smith immediately . I would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more . I wish they 'd air it again or cast Riley Smith in another movie !
Everything about this film is simply incredible . You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a <unk> /><br />I do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse . Do n't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun , <unk> - esque film .
This movie was made 20 years before my time . Its introduction of John Garfield in the supporting role of Mickey Borden makes it a classic . He <unk> onto the screen and your eyes are glued . Garfield was an original and his portrayal of fate 's whipping boy is a must see .
Its a feel - good movie that made me feel good . Some in this genre can be sickly sweet , but this script is restrained . The movie is funny and fun . The acting is great.<br /><br />If this were a musical , I would have left the theater humming the tunes .
Well ... I like this movie first of all because it 's very well thought of ... and well .. because the um ... director and others chose an extremely great actor to play Mike .... and also my last reason because ( my opinion ) Elijah Wood is so so hot ! ! !
Although compared with " Mad Max " , this film is in a league of its own . Set in post apocalyptic Paris , this film is about man 's struggle for survival , he has lost his ability to speak , and there is a remarkable shortage of women . <unk> <unk> <unk> !
You may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to The <unk> <unk> , but this is an absolute classic . Much scarier in premise than the first , and very entertaining . It only got a video release here in the UK , but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy .
Most definitely the saddest movie I have ever seen . A must see , just so you can walk away and realise just how precious your life and loves are . The acting is superb , the story line potentially ' <unk> /><br <unk> a firm favourite of mine even after all this time .
If you like bad movies ( and you must to watch this one ) here 's a good one . Not quite as funny as the first , but much lower quality . A must - see for fans of Jack Frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing .
If you like bad movies ( and you must to watch this one ) here 's a good one . Not quite as funny as the first , but much lower quality . A must - see for fans of Jack Frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing .
If this awful film moved at a <unk> pace it would at least be moving . Watching grass grow would be more interesting . It was painful to sit through and I only stayed in the theatre to see how all the cruel teens would die . Where is Brian DePalma ? ? ? ?
A romp across a <unk> <unk> , this <unk> adventure <unk> through it 's downright <unk> . Comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as Drama from Crisis . Perhaps a little too Queenie for some - I would love to have watched IN a cinema audience in the <unk> . <unk> good
How can so many <unk> decisions can be made . All that waste of <unk> an idiotic story to begin with but there s no need to make it worse . A loose interpretation ? Are you kidding ! it diminishes my regard for Voight and Coburn . I hope they were paid well .
This movie attempts many things but never really accomplishes anything , the plot time travels , meanders and weaves along without really satisfying . It left a hollow , " is that all " feeling at the end . Unless its free to air and there is nothing else on , forget about it .
I knew this would be one of the worst movies I could have imagined ... but in just 20 short minutes it actually exceeded my low <unk> by being possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have already wasted too much time typing about it ... trust me , it sucks .
Second Nature will not go down as one of the worst tv movies of 2003 , but perhaps the worst of All Time . <unk> , derivative , and every performance phoned in , from far , far away . Everyone associated with this project should have a hard time looking in the mirror .
The best independent film of 2001 - I went to see The Wind at the recommendation of friends who caught it at <unk> with Films Festival in LA last summer - it 's a great , scary , well made film . The score was amazing . Ca n't wait to see his next movie !
<unk> <unk> are very good movie . She happen on a mental home in <unk> . <unk> E. <unk> is in a leading role and is good . Other good actors in this movie are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . I like this movie she is very good . I voice with this movie .
before watching this movie my thoughts were like " another <unk> typical movie " but i was <unk> to watch i great <unk> drama . the plot is really good and the actors act great . one of the best <unk> movies i saw ... so at the <unk> i really recommend this movie . :)
Not for everyone , but I really like it . Nice ensemble cast , with nice contributions from better known players ( like <unk> Channing ) and strong eye candy ( from Sheila <unk> ) . What really works is the bond between the three brothers ! Try it , you 'll smile a little .
This is a true " feel - good " movie , full of genuine sweetness and admirable people . Although the premise requires a significant suspension of disbelief , it is worth the trouble to do so . The director , writers , and actors truly convey what it feels like to be in love .
conventional and superficial , <unk> portrayal was incomplete it is supposed that just a few moments with Sheila , makes him win her love , but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence <unk> i don´t know why it was given a PG rating .<br /><br / >
I had the misfortune of seeing this <unk> effort on television a few years ago . Suffice it to say Michael Gross phones in his performance , and Hasselhoff is the least convincing thief / psycho ... EVER ! If you have a couple of hours to kill , watch it and prepare to laugh .
The film is somewhat entertaining , but the greatest feature is <unk> Harlow 's laughable performance . It has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training . Perhaps she should stick to the more worldly , somewhat <unk> characters that she has generated in other performances .
<unk> and predictable plot . The characters are as memorable as the story line . We came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old . Overall a disappointment .
Maybe our standards for <unk> movies have increased since Born on the Fourth Of July , Full Metal Jacket , and Platoon . This movie has a predictable plot , bad writing , bad acting , bad directing , bad special effects , etc . Compared with other Vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable .
Jud Nelson is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoy playing sadistic games on other people . The husband gets his <unk> by burying people alive . If that is n't bad enough , he has a miniature video camera in each coffin so he can watch his victims <unk> .
I enjoyed this movie extremely . It was the last great Mario Van <unk> movie I know of . It had a hip - hop old west flavor to it . Big Daddy Kane and Tone <unk> had major parts . It should n't have won any Oscars , but it was enjoyable all the same .
This is definitely a girl movie . My husband found it utterly boring , but I think this is a really sweet movie . It 's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together . This is a great get - away for anyone who loves a cute , funny romance !
ah man this movie was funny as hell , yet strange . i like how they kept the <unk> language in this movie , it just felt ironic because of how idiotic the movie really was . this movie has got to be one of <unk> 's best movies . highly recommended for some senseless fun !
Several <unk> get on a Russian ship bound for France . They were going to get off there and make new lives for themselves . After being discovered by the First Mate and his henchmen , they were held captive . Then things got very bad for them . Good show based on a true story .
Great movie in a Trainspotting style ... Being billed as the Welsh Trainspotting , but then so was Twin Town , although this is streets <unk> /><br <unk> in a weekend in the life of <unk> <unk> , good debut movie from <unk> and some great performances in the cast.<br /><br />Go see ! then go <unk>
This story focuses on the birth <unk> known as <unk> , or <unk> <unk> Syndrome , a disease diagnosed too often among Native Americans . In spite of the down - beat nature of this drama , the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well . This is arguably <unk> best performance .
I enjoyed Carax 's " Les <unk> du <unk> <unk> " and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard . Well , the first 10 minutes were OK , but then it <unk> into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life . A sad disappointment .
I sat ( uncomfortably ) through this film becoming more and more <unk> at just how it got made at all . The script itself makes the acting look embarrassing , and it fundamentally becomes a waste of time for everybody concerned . If you avoid seeing one film this year , make it this one .
Dorothy Stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci - fi spoof , and her appearance is a disappointment . Though she has the title role , her <unk> is limited , and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue . If you 're not a Stratten fan , pass this one up .
Pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses . Rachel Leigh Cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance , but I would recommend this film only to die - hard fans of the actress .
All the actors in this film seem bored . They are not really interested in their roles and the dialogue is all delivered in monotone . It 's a problem because I think the basic idea for the film is really very sound . I suppose it 's just bad direction which leaves the actors drifting .
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad . I really lost it with those out of the blue not so " special effect " . Guys , If you 're an insomniac go with your girl to see this movie . I give it three <unk> !
I once lived in the <unk> and let me tell you what . I did n't have the <unk> idea what the heck this " bear walk " is . I never heard of it the whole 10 years I was up there . It was really funny in the beginning but went down hill quickly .
I enjoyed Carax 's " Les <unk> du <unk> <unk> " and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard . Well , the first 10 minutes were OK , but then it <unk> into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life . A sad disappointment .
If this movie were in production today it would probably have the <unk> right - <unk> screaming ' child porn ' . It is far from a great film , in fact it is rather pedestrian . However , if you have an imagination and a fond remembrance of youth and first love I recommend it .
People , please do n't bother to watch this movie ! This movie is bad ! It 's totally waste of time . I do n't see any point here . It 's a Stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor . I rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again .
I do n't usually like TV movies , I reckon that if the thing was any good it would make it to Hollywood . This one though is better than average , pretty high production values , a few interesting story twists and some nice shots of NYC ( along with Toronto ) hold the interest .
Not many people have seen this film , and it is a shame because it is a work of art . The characters are brilliant , the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering . I truly loved this film and ca n't wait to see more of Matthew George 's work .
This movie is very good in term of acting and plot . The events and the setting ( i.e. how Chris gets the job , Chris 's work environment , the face - to - face between the two sides , etc ) thereof , on the other hand , are found to be less than realistic .
The casting of Robert Culp is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film . Falk and Culp were marvellous , but as <unk> was not <unk> nemesis this time , chemistry was lacking . Columbo is only as strong as his opposite number , and this time he did n't have one .
<unk> Thornton proves to be a great actor in this little seen movie . Thornton really gets into his characters -- literally . I caught this on cable one night and enjoyed it . Too bad it was released <unk> in theaters the same year as " Fear and <unk> " and " Half - <unk> . "
A very courageous attempt to bring one of the most intricate books of literature to the screen . The story manages to get most of Conrad 's basic messages across and the acting is superb . The liberties taken by the script often <unk> the meaning and do seldom <unk> it . <unk> to writer and director .
this took me back to my childhood in the 1950 's so corny but just <unk> no one ever could play <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> , just great . i have two more series to view flash <unk> 's trip to <unk> and flash <unk> <unk> the universe can not wait < br /><br / >
What can I say ? An excellent end to an excellent series ! It never quite got the exposure it deserved in Asia , but by far , the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on <unk> . EVER ! The end of a great era . Sorry to see you go ...
A powerful " real - tv " movie . Very subversive and therefore remaining almost un - <unk> ! ( almost ... <unk> 2 <unk> in France ) . After you 've watched this <unk> all movies filmed with the same concept ( a documentary team following the events as they arrived ) seem so <unk> /><br <unk>
Really enjoyed <unk> From Heaven . If you liked My Big Fat Greek Wedding you will like this too ! Once the story line is set it begins to keep you guessing the outcome . I think we 'll be hearing more from Five Sisters Productions . I know I 'll be watching for their next movie .
This version is very painful to watch . All of the acting is very stilted but especially that of Norma Shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie . Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford , Robert Montgomery and William Powell which is much more entertaining .
Pauline <unk> gave this movie a good review but it is terrible . It is very outdated , the humour is silly and the music is <unk> . In fact it is so silly it is almost embarrassing . It might have been some fun in 1938 but I can not imagine anyone enjoying it in 2003 .
I saw this video at a friends house , and it was the lamest thing i have seen ever . i lost a lot of the little respect i had for <unk> . very boring , and the music is as equally interesting . do nt waste your time unless you are a hardcore <unk> " fan "
I have NEVER EVER seen such a bad movie before . The scene where they shoot some guy .. The pistol don`t even shoot . Damn that is <unk> . The scene with the boy is even not that good . no script , not any good sound , not anything good to say about this movie ..
I did not like this film at all : The scenario is boring - and after a while , its primitive predictability really gets on your nerves . Even if you give Chabrol a high bonus for not being a <unk> , I did not manage to find anything specially interesting on his characterization of <unk> neither .
I have n't seen all Cage 's works by any means but his acting in this one was truly awful . The other characters run the gamut of ability but , having most of the emotional scenes , Cage 's scenes are just embarrassing to watch . He 's certainly come a long ways in 12 years .
The plot seemed to be interesting , but this film is a great <unk> . Bad actors , a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur . If there was C - movies , this would be a perfect example . A plus for a nice DVD cover though and a great looking female actor .
Sorry , folks ! This is without a doubt the worst film I have ever seen . Sometimes when a movie is really bad you can joke about it and have a good laugh ( like Plan 9 from outer space ) , this movie is so bad you can´t even enjoy it on an ironic level .
William H. Macy is brilliant as <unk> caught in a desperate situation . <unk> off with a bang and never lets up . <unk> and surprises are fresh , unpredictable . Use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30 's and 40 's flicks makes this a delightful " must " for movie buffs .
Hilarious , Sellers at his funniest ... a shame you ca n't get this on video , or even see it on TV anymore ... I 'd love to get a good copy somewhere . Maybe it 's tied up in court on some legal issue , but a truly riotous hospital farce with Sellers as crooked <unk> .
I think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress Drew Barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something I never imagined her being . A great flick with lots of laughs . I do n't usually go for those feel good movies but I really enjoyed this one .
This film is hilarious . Brilliant comedy , but only because of one actor . Chris Farley . The best ' comedy - actor ' I have ever seen . It 's something special about him . He is just so funny.<br /><br />What a shame he is not with us anymore . He will sorely be missed .
This is my favorite Mel Brooks movie because it was the first one I ever saw . I was in the fourth grade when it came out and I watched it all the time . I saw The Producers second and then Blazing Saddles . This is a sentimental favorite because it was my first Mel Brooks movie .
There are no flaws in this production . <unk> entertaining , fun , and worthy of respect.<br /><br />This is what theatre is all about . Definitely not for the very young , but slightly older kids will get a great kick out of seeing it and can be introduced to theatre this way.<br /><br <unk> and amazing .
This was a very funny movie , not Oscar - worthy , but definately the best dollar I 've ever spent at Blockbuster ! Rupert <unk> Jones is a shining star , and very well might be the new Jude Law ! So , if you 're in the mood for a British Teen <unk> RENT IT ! !
Now , I am not prone to much emotion , but I cried seeing this movie . It certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups , but there is something here for everyone . The classic song " It 's so Hard to Say Goodbye " really makes this one worth watching at least once .
Watch it with an open mind , it is very different , nothing 's cutesy about this . Very well done realistic tale of Tarzan . The <unk> <unk> are well done for ' 84 , Christopher Lambert was brilliant imitating <unk> language and behavior . I would n't be surprised if he took lessons from Jane <unk> .
<unk> Wars rips off EVERYTHING in Star Wars . But if you are planning on doing any parody , you need to do it just a bit better than this . Not that there is anything wrong , per se , with <unk> Wars , but if you spoof , do it well , or not at all .
I and a friend rented this movie . We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be <unk> . The movie 's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending . We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot .
This digital horror film brings us into the <unk> - budget film genre where the more blood and chicks in distress the better . The story is weak , the acting is respectable and the special effects , well , they 're special alright . A quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect .
My wife and I saw every episode in this series and loved it . However , the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show . It ended with a typical end - the - season cliff hanger leaving it 's fans feeling cheated . A waste of great writing and acting .
Grim instead of amusing , mean - spirited instead of playful , boring instead of interesting . It wo n't give you " the <unk> " , but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep . And it will certainly make you wonder : " what were they thinking ? " ( * 1/2 )
I tried to be patient and open - minded but found myself in a coma - like state . I wish I would have brought my duck and goose feather pillow ... I apologize to all of the great actors in this movie . Maybe it takes a degree from <unk> to understand the importance of this movie .
I usually like period films but this one just seemed to drag and drag . I 'd <unk> up during Rupert <unk> ' scenes , but Vanessa Redgrave just put me to sleep.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the film . It lacked a little " punch " at the end that I 'd hoped it would have .
Well , I must say , I initially found this short to be quite average , but having watched it nearly 5 times since ( its constantly shown on IFC ) , I 've developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented . Sofia Coppola contributes a solid addition to the category .
It 's not funny , it 's not interesting , it 's not well shot , you do n't care about the characters , not one single one of them . There 's nothing that engages you in the narrative flow , you really could care less what happens . Big , big waste of time and talent .
This is the worst movie of ALL TIME ! It 's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1/3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet . If you actually watch the whole thing , GOD help you .
My wife and I saw every episode in this series and loved it . However , the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show . It ended with a typical end - the - season cliff hanger leaving it 's fans feeling cheated . A waste of great writing and acting .
I 'm not a fan of scratching , but I really dug this movie . It gave me a real insight into a world I never had a clue existed ; and what else is a documentary for ? Funny , clever , hip - just like <unk> 's previous film , <unk> ! about the <unk> music scene .
Is there any question that Jeffrey Combs is one of the true horror greats ? This movie seriously does n't suck and is sort of funny ... Watching a young Combs at work is great but I wish he had had more lines . Look out for Beyond Re - Animator . It 's going to kick some <unk> .
This movie was a <unk> for me while I was surfing from channel to channel ... I do n't know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness . This is what a high budget movie can not do mostly . I liked it , this is " a must see " one ... <br /><br / >
This has been one of the best vampire movies that I have seen in a long time . It was very seductive and alluring , I liked that it did not have the usual gore and carnage that comes along with most vampire movies . The music was excellent . It would be great if there was a sequel .
Another brilliant portrayal by Kiefer Sutherland who plays Mickey Hayden , a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims . I absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm , and I was n't disappointed with " Eye of the Killer " ( AKA After Alice ) . I only wish the movie had been released theatrical first .
the 25th hour was a movie i just <unk> <unk> in late at night , this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire <unk> <unk> is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman , and by simple jealousy , goes on this incredible journey -- terrific movie , and a hidden treasure .
It was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching . The acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people . I was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as " Raging Bull " and " Goodfellas " in this movie A great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing .
Words can hardly describe what Blue Planet brought to life in all of its hours of runtime . <unk> up with Walking With Dinosaurs , this documentary stands as one of the best . We can only pray that the BBC and Discovery Channel come up with even more outstanding ideas that could possibly even level with this one .
The intricate plot , great visuals , the world 's greatest car chase ever make this movie a lot of fun to watch . The beautiful Charlize Theron adds to the enjoyment . The sound score is outstanding . Add to all this an energetic cast that also seems to be having a lot of fun making the movie .
The Book of Life was rather like a short <unk> , <unk> the appetite for Hartley 's next full length movie.<br /><br />This movie does n't need to be seen on the big screen , watch it with a few friends who are Hal Hartley or Wayne Wang fans , or better still , try to convert some <unk> .
<unk> casting , charming and witty throughout . Much like the currency in the opening moments of the film , the story floats along magically until you are emotionally " invested " in its outcome . The city of Buffalo has never looked better ! Kudos to the Burton Sisters and the entire cast for a job well done .
midnight madness is the ultimate <unk> hunt movie for all time . <unk> <unk> fox and <unk> <unk> make respective <unk> fame appearances . laughs abound everywhere and the intrigue of who will emerge <unk> at the end of the great all - <unk> will keep you on the proverbial edge of your seat . a true must see !
It 's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third . After the third that was awful , it 's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas . Chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies . Interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done ....
This is a true gem of corny sci - fi ! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this <unk> movie classic.<br /><br />I particularly like the sound design . The weird choppy voices of the creatures and the <unk> creatures all provide a bizarre backdrop ( Of course the scantily clad babe does n't hurt <unk> /><br / >
I think this is one hell of a movie ........... We can see Steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all Segal movies there 's a message in it , without the message it would be one of many action / fighting movies but the message is what makes <unk> movies great and special .
The acting is good , the action is good , and so is the plot . If you like some good , fast entertainment with an air for authentic action scenes , not the Hollywood ( looks great , but is totally ridiculous ) kind , you 're in for a special treat . Just sit back and enjoy ...
Ah , the classic genre of 80s sex comedies . This is set on two beaches ; one a nude beach featuring myriad ( fully ) <unk> women . The plot ? Something about a bunch of <unk> attempting to get laid . The usual . Fans of gratuitous T&A ( and P ) should hunt this one down .
Nemesis 3 is the worst movie what I have ever seen ! ! ! I think that Nemesis 3 was only 30 minutes long . And that movie was so boo - <unk> - ring . When that movie ends and I saw word : <unk> 4 ... I thought I will ... NOT watch that movie never again .
I found this film to be a bit too depressing . I do n't mind dramas , but this was a bit too much for me . Luckily , there does seem to be somewhat a decent outcome . I suppose it was well done . I 'd watch it again , but it 's nothing to rave about .
A movie that tries hard to say something and generally fails . Like the <unk> <unk> that populate the movie , it meanders aimlessly , substituting endless ( it seems like forever listening to it ) conversation for some action or plot direction.<br /><br />Sadly , it 's one of the best examples of <unk> cinema I 've seen .
Despite the famous cast this animated version of Dickens tale is the <unk> I 've seen . Enough that I <unk> away in he first commercial break . The characters did n't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking <unk> /><br />I'll give this movie a very low rating . Give me the Disney version anytime .
This movie was in one word . Terrible . First of all the people who invented that <unk> that puts you in the TV , are slightly insane ! Secondly , the three teens are so obsessed with the show , it 's scary ! The movie was stupid , and no effort or thought was put into it !
This movie is not very bad <unk> . But one can not find anything new about the personality of Marquis de Sade from this movie . The movie tries to stay on the borderline between erotic and insightful and it can not succeed at either . The cinematography is really bad ( <unk> - to video <unk> /><br / >
This movie is pretty predictable <unk> said .... from the delayed kissing scene to the inevitable coming around of grandpa ... this is a great movie for the 10 - 12 age group but beyond that it has no market .. i give it 4/10 only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more .
It may be difficult to believe , but the basic plot of this abysmal flick has been lifted from Hitchcock 's perennial classic , " Vertigo " . To see Edward James <unk> in the part once played by James Stewart is heart - breaking ; Sean Young is better , but still a poor substitute for Kim Novak .
I went into this movie expecting a <unk> piece about how to be accepted in culture and I wound up blowing $ <unk> on a 10 minute fart joke and a whole bunch of fake accents . Sorry , Jeff , but if you 're going for the whole cult thing , you got ta a while to go .
At the beginning it was almost a shock to see Norma Shearer without her makeup . Then she <unk> herself and becomes the life of the party.<br /><br />Anyway , she <unk> her husband , makes herself over and gets on with her life ; or so she thinks . Somewhat keeps you guessing if they 'll get back together .
I watched this movie the night it premiered on MTV . Usually to me MTV Movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good . Summer Phoenix is an amazing actress and I thought that Nick Stahl was good too . If MTV started showing more movies like this I would probably enjoy the channel a lot more .
<unk> tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the <unk> . With many memorable scenes throughout the film , I found particularly remarkable that close to the end where <unk> and Von Sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea . A fascinating masterpiece !
Lauren <unk> 's debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it . There 's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name <unk> Water . The storyline revolves around a Lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance . 7.5/10
A twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an old - school , white - bred advertising firm . And he intends to make a few changes ... <br /><br />One very strange piece of cinema . You 'll either love it or hate it . Either way , you 've never seen anything like it .
The movie has an excellent screenplay ( the situation is credible , the action has pace ) , first - class direction and acting ( especially the 3 leading actors but the others as well <unk> the mobster , who does not seem to be a professional <unk> /><br />I wish the movie , the director and the actors success .
This is a skillfully crafted piece of cinema that deals with a teenage boys confused sexuality . The cut scenes within can be lengthy but the cinematography is beautiful . This film would not appeal to many people , especially those who are <unk> about gay teenage relationships , but the more open minded can sympathize with the puzzled protagonist .
A sincere tribute to Suzy Parker , who 's just passed away . Not only is <unk> one of the cheesiest movies ever made , but Miss Parker 's performance is , in this cheesy - movie - lover 's opinion , among the worst performances of all time . Her last scene is especially overplayed . I loved it !
I have seen this play many times , from Olivier to Branagh , and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory . Many actors have captured aspects of this character , but for me , it is always Derek Jacobi 's performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short .
The bottom line is : if you come looking for a sci - fi thriller / horror film , The Matrix is what you 'll like . If , like me , you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us , then you need to see <unk>
A stunningly well - made film , with exceptional acting , directing , writing , and <unk> /><br />A <unk> finds married life not what she expected , and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society . Together with her sister <unk> - law , she makes some radical <unk> from conventional roles and mores .
For a made for TV movie I thought that it was a great popcorn movie - do n't expect anything to be very accurate and do n't expect any award winners in this bunch but I do recommend this for a TV type version somewhat like " The <unk> " . Look for cameos from real <unk> players & officials .
This is a truly heartwarming film not just about love , but about learning about yourself and your values in life . Though the story is a novel starting point for a film , it is easily recognized by most people . It combines a wicked sense of humor with a subtle assault on homophobia . Not to be missed .
The performances by the male leads make this long - hard - journey west interesting throughout . The soundtrack by the Sons of The <unk> is one of the most beautiful I have every heard . The journey itself is somewhat episodic , and Joanne <unk> is badly miscast . Overall , this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western .
I liked this show from the first episode I saw , which was the " <unk> in Blue " episode ( for those that do n't know what that is , the <unk> going insane and becoming <unk> <unk> 10 <unk> ) . Best visuals and special effects I 've seen on a television series , nothing like it anywhere .
I knew next to nothing about this movie until I <unk> to rent it . It was a very pleasant surprise . The cast is excellent including Matthau whom I do not normally care for . He makes a credible romantic lead . Hawn is a sweet <unk> and Bergman is touching as a woman coming out of her shell .
The movie I received was a great quality film for it 's age . John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry . His on screen presence <unk> thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him . I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film .
I just wanted to say that . I love <unk> <unk> , so I automatically loved this movie . Everything else about it was so - so ... Billy Crystal is a good actor , even if he is annoying . But the thing that made this movie <unk> at least , for a basketball <unk> seeing <unk> <unk> act .
I could n't even sit through the whole thing ! This movie was a piece of crap ! I had more fun watching " Do nt ' Tell Mom The <unk> 's Dead " ! It was just too painful to watch . Say , besides " Austin Powers " , has Tom Arnold ever been in a hit movie ?
This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures . Sure , the effects are laughable , the story confused , but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun . I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in , it added to what little suspense was <unk> . Give it a 3 .
Imagine this ... <br /><br <unk> two people meet in this movie , one of them is shot . The plot just does not exist - it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it . If you decide to watch it , you will regret it .
Team Spirit is maybe made by the best intentions , but it misses the warmth of " All Stars " ( 1997 ) by Jean van de <unk> . Most scenes are <unk> , just not that funny and not that well done . The actors repeat the same lines as in " All Stars " but without much feeling .
<unk> a very good book and completely butchered it . Nothing was as it should have been . Some of the best parts of the book were missing , including the major point of the whole book . Simply the worst adaptation of a Stephen King novel ever . This movie made the mini - series for IT look good .
I like Steven Seagal but I have not a <unk> what this movie was about . I am not easily lost with movies but I had no idea who was on who 's side.<br /><br />Hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better . My wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans , however . <unk>
Oh boy ! It was just a dream ! What a great idea ! Mr Lynch is very lucky most people try to tell classical stories . This way he can play with his little <unk> and his even more little <unk> . Check out Polanski 's " The <unk> " for far more intelligent mix of fantasy and reality .
Even Sophie <unk> 's presence and the few ( very few ) good French gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie ! A disappointment . The story is weak and so is acting . This movie was advertised as the French version of The Mummy , but the Mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects ...
The first bottom movie was an absolute laugh from the beginning . <unk> made and thought out . I will definitely take my hat off to the production team and the actors . The Bottom actors attempt to run a hotel . If you look closely this film was most probably shot in the Isle Of <unk> , near my home .
This Showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of New York ... from the naive and innocent tourists ' nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets ... to an old friend 's betrayal , it has it all.<br /><br />Well worth a look , as is its sequel .
This is one of the great ones . It works so beautifully that you hardly notice the miscasting of then 37 year old Dana Andrews as the <unk> soda jerk who goes to war and comes back four years later , when he would have been , at most , 25 . But then , who else should have played him ?
A boat builder in a sleepy town in Maine is going out of business , and the lives of all of the ( soon to be <unk> and families are disrupted . The biggest disappointment is that the two stars -- Bates and Bridges -- have only bit parts.<br /><br <unk> , but not something you would see <unk> /><br / >
If you 're interested in learning about the ' real ' side of spying , this movie is for you . Unlike 007 movies , this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage . Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn both give outstanding performances in this not - so - well - known film . Certainly worth watching .
A Jane Smiley novel , loosely based on Shakespeare 's KING <unk> about the Cook family and its dark secrets . Director <unk> seems <unk> in her approach , allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow . And how could you go wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer , Lange , Leigh , <unk> , Carradine and Robards ?
I have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind . Full Moon Pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night . For all the cheesiness of most vampire films , This Is the ONE that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels . A Must See .
This film is good , but not <unk> best . My favourite is <unk> and Patton , but this is a sad and very nice film . Kris <unk> is good in this movie and really makes a difference . I am going to miss <unk> and this is his last film.<br /><br />A good film by a great director ! <unk>
This film makes Clooney . All his films combined before this have all been based on the same character . This film he transcends his previous body of work and proves his capability as a top notch actor . The soundtrack defeats most one - handedly . The brothers have truly made a classic . One to own and watch repeatedly .
Brian Keith as Cole <unk> and Richard <unk> as <unk> <unk> make excellent villains . They just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible , and <unk> <unk> at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends . It 's a pity that goody - goody Glenn Ford gets in their way .
Renoir 's tale of Paris , the <unk> , a <unk> - girl and the Moulin Rouge . A more subdued , but highly entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge . Jean <unk> gives his usual excellent performance . The Technicolor photography on the print I saw was exquisite . An easy evening 's viewing . <unk> w <unk>
I found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining . Good characters , good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout . The plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller . If you liked this film I would recommend The Spanish Prisoner , The House of Games and No Way Out .
I love this Disney Movie ! Its a real cute movie , and when it comes on again , I will have to make a mental note to tape it . I really like how they break into the bank trying to find Susie 's parents information . You should really see this movie . Its great for the whole family .
The story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still <unk> /><br />The science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie , we have been shown of <unk> /><br />Other than that , everything looks ok !
This sci - fi great fortunately has little to do with the first one . Elias <unk> , Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked . Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by <unk> ole <unk> helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget .
I do n't <unk> because I think it 's gay but this game is really great it 's smooth , fast , easy to play , and just fun even if you do n't do so well . It can be just really fun to make the <unk> just crash and burn , easily one of the best video games ever !
The only redeeming scene in this movie is when the robots are sent out to fight ' karate style ' , there was one good spinning side - kick ... and that is the best 3 seconds of the movie . Unfortunately , the rest of the movie has very little to recommend it -- there are better spoofs out there .
This film is truly execrable in all departments . Script , acting , plot , direction and editing are all uniformly awful . I give it 1 out of 10 simply because people turned up to make it . I would have given it 2 out of 10 if they had all stayed at home instead . Avoid at all costs !
I found this early talkie difficult to watch and I 'm a Norma Shearer fan ! It 's not her fault , but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored . 90 % of the movie is filmed with " medium shots , " and it 's very similar to watching a dull play .
This old stinker makes the Flash Gordon movies look sophisticated . It 's so terrible I love it , and I wish I could find a tape , but none of the <unk> I 've checked list it . The rock band leader who calls himself Commander Cody must have loved it too , because he named his band after it .
<unk> <unk> proves that Britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from America . The only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an American film would and a cameo by Ram John <unk> , which is always welcome . That 's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter 's night .
I really enjoyed this movie about a dog who becomes a Duke . It would have been very easy to mess this one up , but along with the humor , the script was filled with warmth and even some <unk> about nobility and class . It 's a feel good movie that the whole family can watch .. even the adults !
Great cult flick for <unk> K types : Richard Boone is a mess -- bad hair , <unk> , even his dark glasses are n't right ; about as good as a bad <unk> - flick can get ... actually , that charging saber - <unk> <unk> was pretty cool -- maybe Spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one .
This film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir Western - after the ill - conceived opening flashback sequence anyway . The scenery is beautifully desolate , the characters achingly isolated . While some of the acting is less than believable , the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look .
Well this was the WWF 's last pay per view event of the millennium and it ended the year and millennium right . The huge story line of Stephanie and HHH started right here at this event when <unk> turned on her dad . Vince McMahon had a great match with HHH and this event is very good I give it a 9
Because of the depth of his character studies and complexity of story lines , James Joyce 's works do not easily translate into film . Yet John Huston , in his last film before his death , achieved a perfect translation of Joyce 's story . He received great support from his son , as writer , and daughter , as actress .
I happened to leave HBO on last night following Six Feet Under . What ran next has left me speechless . What an incredible piece of work . I do n't just recommend this , I <unk> that you see this . It 's better than anything Hollywood could ever ruin . I just hope they never get their hands on it .
A must for any die hard <unk> <unk> /><br <unk> <unk> does the role of <unk> a <unk> amount of justice , and although the ' story ' is n't 100 % factual , is still a good insight into the lives of both Richard and Karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack.<br /><br <unk> me cry <unk> /><br / >
The movie takes place during the year 1940 and the French are about to loose the war.<br /><br />The movie includes all genres : comedy , romantic , murder and history . It is probable the historical part may be not as probable as the rest.<br /><br />It is not , however , a big laugh movie but the occasional large smile !
I do n't even like watching those late night talk shows , but I found this one really interesting . I imagine it 's probably close to the truth --- it " feels " like an honest account , if that means anything . Kinda feel for the people somewhat when you watch it . A nice movie for a Saturday night .
Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula <unk> 's touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline . This gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you 've seen something <unk> )
Coming from Oz I probably should n't say it but I find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline . This comedy lacks in nothing . Great story , no overacting , no melodrama , just brilliant comedy as we know Oz can do it . Do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop .
< br /><br />It was n't the worst movie that I have ever seen . However , that is only if I get to count home movies made by 8 year olds . This movie was horrible from start to finish . Nothing about it made it worth watching unless you wanted to show new filmmakers how not to make a film .
Like another ticket <unk> I saw a nice cute poster about this film , it 's five star review , and awards won . Thought what the heck , let 's by a ticket for myself and my two sons . BAD <unk> . The movie was not a family film , it was gratuitous , and it contained nothing worth watching .
I ca n't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme . Totally unrealistic ( they seemed to want it to be HIGHLY realistic but all the elements are based on clichés ) , real propaganda stuff . After seeing this , an addict probably just want to continue his / her career :-) I gave it 2 .
The first <unk> film was enjoyable by adults as well as children . This one starts with about an hour of filler where not much happens , with stilted dialogue ; only in the last act is there any significant action that really moves the plot along . The dog is still cute , though , and young kids may enjoy it .
Proof if ever more was needed , that an action movie , <unk> of its budget , can LOOK better with more <unk> ( or cameras ) , closer shots , and many more cuts . The ' <unk> ' generation has moved on to John Woo . Deep <unk> could be better for a work over in the cutting room . Ray
This movie about a man on the run for killing a mobster is the kind of film you can watch entirely on fast forward , once you know who 's who , and not lose a thing . It has an attractive cast but the plot is a virtual writer 's guide to cinema cliche , and boy does the dialogue <unk> !
Usually I have a lot of luck with these small scale movies . I looked at the cast . Leary , <unk> , Delpy , Wuhrer , <unk> . How bad could it be ? Unfortunately the answer was ... pretty bad . I have a hard time remembering a movie that had such poor execution of a plot that had potential .
The opening credits are pure poetry and I have watched it several times . It had a corny 20 's adventure feel to it . Of course Kathy is gorgeous , but that voice ! Did she realize this was a talkie . One word -- voice coach . Great film for chronic insomnia ( along with a bottle of <unk> ) .
I rented this movie primarily because it had Meg Ryan in it , and I was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one . Not only is she not on screen much , but nothing her character does is essential to the plot . Her character could be written out of the story without changing it much .
This is a great TV miniseries of a classic novel . Janet McTeer and John <unk> , in the lead roles , are exceptional . This is one of the best adaptations from a book that I have seen . I would LOVE to get a copy of this - let me know if you know how I might get one ... Thanks !
I think this is <unk> Shore 's best stuff , he played the part perfect . I really enjoyed this movie , Patrick <unk> is really funny as Zack the annoying little brother . Son In Law is a good comedy worth your time , but the only thing I wish Tiffany <unk> was the farm chick instead of the one they had .
We enjoy a film like " <unk> " because we imagine we are there ourselves - music , dance and drama students , enjoying our self expression . This film had humour , entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to have a go at the performing arts . Bravo " <unk> " . Certainly worth 8 out of <unk> /><br />Chris
An eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious <unk> compound near Waco , Texas . <unk> - six people , including <unk> leader , David <unk> , <unk> in a flaming <unk> that destroyed the compound . There is still heated debate over how the fire started . Homicide or suicide ? Can you still trust government <unk> /><br / >
This movie was sweet . The main character lady was sensitive to 2 different men who wanted her . She seemed not a character at all but a real person who had made some mistakes but was trying to set things right . I liked the movie a lot . Even the older ladies who were lesbian did n't irritate me too much .
This film is totally <unk> . It manages to be thought provoking , funny , tragic , and cinematic yet <unk> /><br />Although the flashbacks are unnecessary , the film maintains a <unk> , <unk> grip and the performances are all excellent , in particular Alec Baldwin , and the mesmerising Eric <unk> as the film 's anti - hero , Barry <unk> .
' <unk> Willie ' is the first cartoon with sound . Mickey Mouse is working on a <unk> . On board he is making music with all kind of tools . Most of those tools are farm animals . This first one with sound is one of the better and funnier ones . It has some very clever moments . A short classic .
An obscure horror show filmed in the <unk> . Two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the <unk> of the locals . Who , or what , are the Blood <unk> ? After awhile they find out . Watch for the character of the village idiot who <unk> like a chicken , he certainly is weird .
Very <unk> . Quite corny . Acting gets worse as the show goes on . Do n't believe anything that folks say about the " realism " that this movie is supposed to portray . It 's just a <unk> up . Interesting twist in that the <unk> <unk> the base were given a human face and were n't portrayed as evil <unk> .
A sprawling , <unk> , <unk> comedy that has no dramatic center . It was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair ( at least in some episodes ) , but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole , and the laughs are few and far between . <unk> ending , though . ( * 1/2 )
Believe it or not , this was at one time the worst movie I had ever seen . Since that time , I have seen many more movies that are worse ( how is it possible ? ? ) Therefore , to be fair , I had to give this movie a 2 out of 10 . But it was a tough call .
What does this movie have ? Lots of gunfire and expensive effects . Nothing makes sense on any other level.<br /><br />Watching Arnold cry is seeing acting so bad that it is laughable . The plot is <unk> /><br />If you think the Devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun , well , this movie is for you !
I watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of movies like Pulp Fiction and <unk> Dogs . The best of the best . It was never any dull and always moving , every hour there 's another character bothering ( trying to kill ) him . You never know what 's next . In one word <unk> ! ! !
Superb ! Even the <unk> was laughing at the end . And what a " balcony " scene ! This film has it all . <unk> funny and yet strangely faithful to the Bard of <unk> . ( But NOT for the <unk> of Heart ! ) AND ... the Best <unk> since Monty Python and The Holy Grail ! I am " <unk> !
Born Bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids . <unk> as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining . The movie is similar to The Black Circle Boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences .
Very funny film with some of the best swedish actors . It 's all filmed in black and white with the true <unk> feeling . Most of the film you are aboard a train headed for Berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns . I truly recommend this film if you like to laugh .
Not high art , not even exceptionally innovative , but a thoroughly enjoyable movie . Funny , fresh , intelligent - there are still people out there who do n't need millions of dollars to hide that they 're out of ideas.<br /><br />When you compare this to your average Hollywood action flick , you 're comparing a homemade meal with a big <unk> .
< br /><br />Well - known comedians <unk> admit they wish they could do real satire like Bill Hicks . <unk> these pitiful <unk> , we are treated to what an exceptionally talented comedian can achieve when he could otherwise be chasing fame and fortune . He did n't get his own talk show , but at least he was no one 's puppet .
Watched this on <unk> , with Frank Baxter commenting , as I recall . Have never seen it since , but would like to find out where it is available.<br /><br />It is amazing how good something can be , but be in black and white , and have zero special effects . In fact , amazing how much BETTER something like that is !
This film ai n't half bad . It may be a little long at times , but carried along by beautiful scenery , an <unk> beautiful love letter and great actors , you forget time and enjoy . The grand prize , however , goes to <unk> <unk> and Geraldine <unk> as .......... well that would be telling , but they are just GREAT !
The plot starts out interesting , however , towards the end too many die in too short a time , turning the thriller - mystery aspect of the story into a <unk> /><br />The only true highlights were Adam Beach and <unk> Prochnow , who were once again their excellent selves . Nice try with an inappropriate last third , though a good ending .
This is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end . The acting was bad , the plot was worse , and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class . Dennis Weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part . My advise , DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE !
If this was the best <unk> cinema had to offer these years , my worst fears have come true . I have NEVER , even in <unk> movies , seen worse acting . I could n't get myself to watch it for more than 40 minutes , so if that 's the cause of me missing the genius , so be it.<br /><br / >
The films ' producers are hoping that Cameron Diaz ' name will help sell this picture . Unfortunately , nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen . Despite some beautifully shot European locations and some solid production design elements , the film fails mostly due to its awkward , unbelievable romance between Brewster and <unk> . An <unk> <unk> experience .
I had no expectations when seeing the movie because I was seeing it with a bunch of friends and had no idea what it was . Some parts were silly and some parts were lame , but overall the movie was worth watching . I like goth looking women ; this movie has plenty of it . The fangs do look really lame though .
An updated version of a theme which has been done before . While that in and of itself is not bad , this movie does n't reach the ring like the other " inherent and pure " evil ones do . < br /><br <unk> , ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark . Not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending .
OK , so it 's a silly movie , but I think they knew that when they made it . And there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired , overdone " <unk> genre . <unk> a tape just because I knew someone in it , but I did loan it out to a couple pals , who also kinda liked it .
An interesting period <unk> showing us what was amazing in 1938 . Gosh , Ma , a fake accident ring <unk> for $ <unk> ! ! ! I guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money . The acting would amount to pure 21st century ham . Nice to see the president as a hard - working newcomer .
My kids enjoyed the movie , but I was bored . There were a few good lines and a handful of funny parts , but the plot was pretty lame and relied on the special effects and gadgets to pull it through . Still , it hit the center of the <unk> that it was aiming for : it was good for the kids .
If your expecting Jackass look somewhere else this an actual movie and for the budget well done the acting is nt top <unk> neither is the writing but the directing was there and so was the story <unk> worth the rent and possibly the buy if you really enjoy it like i did . But for the person who just likes jackass rent it first .
The answer ..... No , sadly not . Though <unk> and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treat . The drama , suspense , romance and the <unk> crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of <unk> . A enlightening experience , one for all the family !
This may be one of the best movies I have ever seen . It has anything but a trite plot , and leaves one wondering which way it will go next . It is an interesting portrayal of the struggles of youth , youth who are interested in more than immediate gratification , youth who show some concern about the desires and needs of others .
One of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 80 's , Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage in a starring role . Deborah <unk> is fun as the object of Cage 's desire ( and whatever happened to her ? ) . Look for veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie 's hippie parents - they 're quite funny !
What a show ! Lorenzo Lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit , by being a good cop . Then , again , he shows how sensitive a cop can be , displaying a range of emotions like no other actor can except , maybe , himself in <unk> justice.<br /><br <unk> <unk> !
A wonderful Christmas story on the moving theme of " Susie <unk> finds her <unk> Amazon . " No , I 'm serious ! <unk> Davis 's amnesia starts to improve when she is knocked on the head . From this familiar beginning , we move in an unexpected direction . Good pace , good action , fun story , lots of explosions and mayhem .
<unk> 's journey through the final days of <unk> , <unk> sprinkled with flashbacks to a sexually active and diverse <unk> /><br />It 's definitely not a feel - good romance movie . It is a romance movie , but one without illusions . Everyone 's an adult here , not your cup of tea if you want another <unk> in Seattle or Notting Hill .
A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the <unk> <unk> receives , much to his horror , a Toronto <unk> <unk> sweater in the mail . I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey , but nearly everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the Toronto / <unk> rivalry . Highly entertaining , amusing , and accurate .
There are many things to admire about this film , but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse , the sort of role that Hollywood loves & <unk> but which here is absolutely convincing & unlike any character I 've <unk> in film or in life . Also a very convincing & disturbing depiction of <unk> 's syndrome
Some TV programs continue into embarrassment ( my beloved ' X - Files ' comes to mind . ) I 've been a fan of Dennis <unk> since ' Crime Story , ' another late , <unk> show . ' Buddy <unk> ' never had a chance . The series had a good premise and great actors . It 's really , really a shame .
I loved this movie ! I 'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters . Every story was better than the last .. much better than the much hyped " Scream " series and " I Know What You Did Last <unk> way better than the terrible " Urban Legend " . I 'd recommend this film to every horror fan .
Very lovely love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina . The whole story is very bizarre and funny . An <unk> ( A. Molina ) loves a married woman ( <unk> ) . They try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village . A scenario of strange situations starts . As good as <unk> <unk> and LONG LIVE <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! If you are looking for special effects that are 10 - 20 years before its time , this is it . The glowing lightning bolts , <unk> , etc . look like they came from a cheesy 70 's sci - fi flick . And yes , Hercules really grows ; he 's not being pushed on a <unk> closer to the camera !
This is one for the Golden Turkey book . It 's another of those " putting on a show " flicks . The dialogue is turgid . The music is terrible . The costumes may be the worst ever . And the Nick Castle choreography is hilariously dreadful . Check it out , oh ye who love bad flicks . Only Perry <unk> is tolerable .
I 'm glad I did n't pay to see ' The <unk> <unk> /><br />I sat there hopefully waiting for something original and/or funny to happen.<br /><br />It reminded me very much of those predictable English comedies of the <unk> /><br />I wo n't bother with a synopsis of the plot , I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes < br /><br / >
Low budget horror about an evil force . Hard to believe in this day and age , but way back when this stuff actually used to get theatrical release ! These days this sort of thing would either go direct - to - video or straight to cable . Should n't be too hard to avoid this one ; who 's ever heard of it ?
< br /><br />Very slow , plodding movie with a confusing story line . The movie 's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals . Ellen Barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much - younger <unk> Wilson . Not sure what this movie was about .
This is a piece of Hollywood product that should have never left a film can . Dialogue without a plausible thought , plot without a point , staging without skill , directing without direction , and acting without the worth of some <unk> high school 's freshman class play . The entire cast should have been arrested for over acting.<br /><br />But otherwise , okay !
Jim <unk> 's first real movie is quite a delight , but do n't come in expecting to see Ernest P. <unk> any time soon . I felt the wide array of characters <unk> depicted were great , but without being said , the rest of the movie should be put into a <unk> or something . A rather odd beginning for a movie icon .
The first movie of this series was well written and original . This show drags on , poorly written gags , boring flashbacks , not the comedy that I expected . Even the young folks found it boring . There are certainly bright moments , historical elements and some good acting , but overall I can only recommend this for DVD / tape at home .
I would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie I have ever seen . It 's not just the actors that are bad , but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time . Anyone that likes this must be crazy ! THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME
Although the movie was only so so the closed <unk> was by far the best I have ever seen ! Most of the time the spelling is terrible and the <unk> out of sync . I use the closed <unk> even though I can hear well but find a lot of actors <unk> . Also many times the sound track <unk> the dialogue . Thanks !
A truly masterful piece of filmmaking . It managed to put me to sleep and to <unk> my mind . So boring that it <unk> sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made . Avoid at all costs . That is , unless you like taking invisible <unk> punishment , in which case I highly recommend it .
This is definitely one of the best Kung fu movies in the history of Cinema . The screenplay is really well done ( which is not often the case for this type of movies ) and you can see that Chuck ( in one of his first <unk> a great actor . The final fight with the <unk> deputy in the <unk> is a masterpiece !
The odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes does n't . Had the main male character been a little more interesting , the film would have been as well . A trio of young Americans visit Paris , run into a beautiful werewolf , and the problems <unk> from there.<br /><br <unk> logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take .
<unk> is , I think , a very <unk> Hitchcockian film . The plot was rife with symbolism ( ie the white and red roses ) and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly . The look was very Parisian and pulled you closer to the story . I saw it in London and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
I would just like to say that The Cure was a <unk> movie to help inform how people who are HIV positive have to function in life . <unk> a young boy who ca nt go to school because he could <unk> someone . and the ignorance of the boys who called them <unk> . that just shows how much children are not educated about aids .
Evil warlord puts a town through pain and suffering . Not long before they call upon giant stone samurai <unk> for help . <unk> soon comes and really gets the warlord with all his <unk> might . The revenge climax is really funny as <unk> <unk> guys under his feet and crushes guys with his fist and even drives a spike though a man 's heart .
My companions were astounded to find that this movie was a documentary . It was so funny , it seemed scripted , yet it gives a stirring picture of real life in the indie film life . We felt moved to purchase <unk> and wanted to meet Mark and Mike . As college students , this film gave us a much needed glimpse of real life .
Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action / comedy but i do n't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast . The end of the movie come , the bad guy dies and that 's it.<br /><br />The special effects are good and i do n't regret paying to see it at the theatre .
This movie was groundbreaking in the former Soviet Union because it was the first movie released there that contained a real sex scene . However , the movie can be considered great for many reasons , not the least of which is its true , gritty portrayal of disillusionment and pain in the family of a working class Soviet family . I would definitely recommend it .
a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels . I hope Somebody , someday will be able to film it the right way . In the meantime , look for the books ( by A. <unk> ) , a very <unk> , <unk> fantasy . By now there should be a translation in english , there <unk> in german for sure .
Gone is the wonderful campiness of the original . In place is a c - grade action no - brainer , <unk> is not all bad , but pales in comparison to the original . All the meaningless sex and violence is gone , and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot <unk> . See it , but do n't expect the thrills of the first .
Camp Blood looked great when I was buying it , but when I watched it boy was I wrong . Its tacky , the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking . Being a movie fan , I usually find humour from tragic horror , but at times I could n't even laugh . Maybe Camp Blood 2 will be an improvement .
This film is bad . It 's filled with glaring plot holes , characters who are ruled by stupidity , bad acting and above all , a poor script which has been done before in many , many films , only better . I feel sorry for Donald Sutherland , I just hope he had to do this film rather than wanted to ! Miss it .
This movie is awful , just awful . Someone bought it for me as a Christmas present because they knew I liked a good horror flick . I do n't think they understood the " Good " part . All I can say is next year this person is getting slipper socks from me . Avoid this <unk> it makes you bitter . <unk> /><br / >
This was a crappy , miserably acted movie based on <unk> male fantasies . A shame that it was based in Texas , an otherwise excellent state . I would recommend this movie to no - one , and wish that it had never entered my consciousness as I am now so irritated that I wasted my brain cells even paying the slightest attention to it .
The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this film is " <unk> of Horrors , " but I think that must be an error . It should have been called " <unk> of <unk> . " Horrible acting , horrible editing , horrible story , and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible <unk> /><br <unk> .
My friends and I rented this movie <unk> it for another one about <unk> . <unk> Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is hilarious . The movie is so incredibly predictable and over the top that it ended up being a laugh fest . Even though I gave it a 1/10 this movie should be seen especially if u manage to catch it on TV anywhere .
This film is worth seeing since it is a classic in the sense of being the very first full length film released in the process of three <unk> . It was not very good in its acting or story plot , but can be a great movie <unk> question from an historical standpoint . It should be seen in the 3 D process with <unk> lenses .
I wish they would just make a special section in the video rental stores for movies like this . The section would read : " Movies for lonely older men who like to watch young girls being naughty and wearing fetish clothes " I guess <unk> <unk> , after <unk> <unk> now this , is establishing herself as the queen of the dirty old man genre .
There is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie . It should never have been made . The first one , one of my favourites , An American Werewolf in London , is a great movie , with a good plot , good actors and good FX . But this one ? It stinks to heaven with a cry of <unk> /><br / >
<unk> is really not a movie about Star Trek <unk> . It 's a freak show about those Star Trek fans who have no sense of reality . As a freak show , it 's fine . But it is a mistake to think that this movie gives you an insight into Star Trek fans . Most Star Trek fans cringe at what this movie shows .
Ok , I will make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie . Everybody knows of Motion Picture Association of America 's ratings : G , PG , PG-13 , R , and NC-17 . For the purposes of this movie , I think the <unk> should create a new rating standard : <unk> .
While possibly the stupidest , most tasteless , and violent slapstick comedy ever made , Guest House is also a very funny one . Do n't listen to the critics , they have no sense of humour . While the climax runs out of steam ( but not vomit ) , it 's still a funny party movie . Seven candles in the eye out of ten .
This movie I watched back in 1981 when it came out . Although I missed the first part of the movie what I did see was great . this movie is hard to find but if found you must see . The acting is great . very believable sad movie . If I ever find me a copy I definitely will buy me a copy to treasure .
I thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that I 've ever seen . I 've seen a lot too . The effects were great , and the casting was brilliant . It was an all around good movie . The makeup and costumes were great too . I would recommend it , but not for kids . It 's not a children 's movie .
GREAT MOVIE ! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie . Jennifer Tilly ( Tiffany ) makes this movie even better ! Well before Chucky died Tiffany and him were together . But like ten years later Tiffany gets Chucky back ( as a doll ) and brings him back to life . It was a great <unk> and <unk> funny ( only because <unk>
I was completely drawn into the story , but I wonder if perhaps I should n't have been so sympathetic to the Hurt character 's plight for respect . Because when it boils down , I really think that glam reporters such as Barbara Walters is the devil . ... or maybe the filmmakers were telling us that we 're all unknowing supporters of fluff news stories .
I think that the movie was really good . <unk> , acting and <unk> <unk> <unk> Khan 's music were marvellous . Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male - dominated culture , he has neglected <unk> 's character a bit and has <unk> more on the violence faced by her .
Although the plot of this film is a bit far - fetched , it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and <unk> . The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent . Caine hams it up ... which is exactly what the character he is playing should do . Entertaining and fun , this is a hour and a half of easy watching .
Was struck at how even the acting was throughout . William Haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film . Not over the edge . There are moments where the camera work is most excellent , and combined with the story , like when he is waiting to see the <unk> , very well done.<br /><br / > <unk> enjoyed the flick.<br /><br / >
They are hunted and starving . They are completely <unk> and yet they press on through sheer <unk> . This film tries to answer the question " How far will human beings go to survive ? " <unk> <unk> from every of this film and like so many <unk> films of this time , it <unk> the blind military loyalty that pressed the <unk> people into war .
Saw this film the first time in 1953 with my older brother . It was one of the great 3 <unk> films released in that era . We saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it . Scott does a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the Indian arrows rather than surround sound . Oh , for those <unk> lenses again .
I must admit that this is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . I thought Dennis Hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of <unk> . If this is supposed to be funny then I got ta look around for a new sense of humor . If you 're thinking of buying this movie you 'd better think again .
This was a fabulous premise based on lots of factual history . But the serious lack of character development left us not really liking or caring about any of the characters , especially the <unk> ! She did not get any sympathy ; she seems like she deserved his own black cloud . The songs were great to a point , but became repetitive after a while .
< br /><br />12 Grand is the cost of a new car . A new car that Jake West now needs to escape the hordes of angry villagers desperate for his blood . Some may say this film could attract " So bad it 's good " status . In my <unk> it is the proud owner of the " So bad it 's Bad " label .
Adventures in <unk> City , though a creative idea , was a <unk> atrocious attempt at filmmaking . Being sucked into a TV and into a new world is interesting . Three teens <unk> enthralled with half - animated dinosaurs is not . Do n't waste the time or the brain power to see this sure loser . I would n't even let my kids watch it .
So many films are now in a Genre described as " Comedy / Thriller " , as was this one . A fine cast , interesting premise , but what an unpleasant film to watch . Into <unk> films ? Then either " Saving Grace " or " Lock , Stock ... " are far more enjoyable films . Rating : Just 2 out of 10 Roach <unk>
If it had not been for Christopher Guest 's hilarious role , I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes . The jokes were flat , the movie choppy and slow paced , certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch , but Guest 's character kept me laughing so I stuck with it.<br /><br />I do feel there are much better choices out there !
This is a truly awful movie . The jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right endurance test . The only thing funny to come out of this production is it 's comparison to the classic film " This Is Spinal Tap . "<br /><br />Avoid this film as if it were one of the plagues of the Bible itself.<br /><br / >
The worst film ever made , bar none . Give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it . Except for the bit where the hard - luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation pours his <unk> soup on the doctor 's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should ... that 's all .
They 've shown i twice in a very short time now here in Sweden and I am so very tired of it . The bad acting is n't enough ... The story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists . I love the original from 1953 so I recommend you to go and rent that one instead . Because this one is such a bore .
It 's been over 30 years now but I still remember that this movie was the worst I 've ever seen . I would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but I was mistaken . I just finished watching " <unk> <unk> " and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than " <unk> <unk> " .
I will not even make any more comments about this movie . Instead I will make a recommendation for all you Euro - horror fans : If you want to see an enjoyable low - budget Vampire flick , check out <unk> <unk> ( 1998 ) . It has everything Razor Blade <unk> lacks : acting , nice locations , terrific score , and less <unk> vampires ...
Well , I do n't normally think there 's such a thing as a HORRIBLE movie , but this is pretty damned close ! The best acting performance in the whole thing was Snoop Dogg , who has one line in a 10 second scene . I agree with the " glad it was short " review . The music videos at the end were cool though .
<unk> <unk> is for sure a great movie . I have to give it to Mani <unk> for a great directing job and <unk> <unk> for great songs . The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan . I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work .
..... <unk> - looks like it 's gon na cost you a whopping £ <unk> to buy a copy ( either DVD or Video <unk> <unk> <unk> /><br <unk> /><br />Sorry about this , but IMDB wo n't let me submit this comment unless it has at least 10 lines , so ........... <br /><br <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ! < br /><br / >
< br /><br />Her <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has worked in countless movies over life time . I think best is yet to come.<br /><br <unk> is <unk> /><br />But still good days are yet to come.<br /><br />Hopefully , in Water I will be able see her better.<br /><br />Thanks and <unk> /><br />PS : India does n't have a director to make best use of her .
I saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still <unk> me , as it should . Her anger and initiative were inspiring . Not that I would <unk> an army and kill people , but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind . This is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter .
This movie was good . I ca n't say it was one of the best , but it still was good . The only reason that I watched it was because of Ryan <unk> . He is soo hot ! ( Do n't get mad Reese ) . But I think that it was sort of <unk> not a laugh your head out kinda thing , but still O.K.
<unk> is certainly one of Tobe Hooper 's best films . It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity , so it seems like a typical horror fan 's dream . The film is quit creative though and I think that 's because of the script from Dan <unk> and Don <unk> . Nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film .
For a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million , this little movie that could deserves a ' best we could ' award . Interesting premise ( aside from the usual meteor stuff ) with solid <unk> by a cast of familiar faces . 2 thumbs up . <unk> to the other reviewer : Do n't be afraid to say you liked something .
John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller . Every time this has been on HBO I 've had to stop and watch it . John tells the story of how he grew up ( probably some fact and fiction ) and adds hilarious stories in the midst . If you like John 's comedy I would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best .
Well in to 2002 I 've got some catching up to do . And looking back on a lacklustre year , Best In Show shone . No great storyline . Little action . Just a <unk> of magnificent characters . <unk> reference to Fred Willard and Jim <unk> as a rattling pair of TV commentators . Well done . Well worth the effort.<br /><br <unk> ( <unk> <unk> )
Hey , its great not to have to wait for the next Star - Trek convention to see hick - trek ! Its a cheesy film by a bunch of <unk> with no budget , but a good way to spend an hour . They got most of the special effects right , the dialog is classic trek and it just feels right for a trek - knockoff .
Many funny scenes about the people that you do n't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do . Lou Myers was very funny as Half - Step Wilson . Any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non - movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie .
Looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction ? You just found it . This superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker ( Mark <unk> ) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film I have ever seen -- probably because it 's also one of the most tragic . Oddly enough , the more I watch the film the more inspired I become .
DON'T EVEN <unk> to figure out the logic of this story . But do ride along with 10-year - old Gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed . More weird characters and implausible situations than a Twin Peaks reunion ! Nothing makes sense , yet it 's impossible to stop watching <unk> ! Now , where can I find that ' R ' ? ? ? ?
If you are looking for King Kong , you <unk> your search ! This is a low - low budget movie that was <unk> > <unk> to entertain people in a comic sense . Here is the > most ordinary human who is the only 1 who can save the > world from a <unk> ' 300 ton <unk> . Surely you can see the humor in that .
A brilliant professor and his sidekick journey to the center of the earth in a huge machine which screws its way to the core . There , naturally , they find all kinds of things that are intent on killing and eating them . Plus , of course , a love interest for the young sidekick . Ho hum , does the plot never take a different tack ?
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in my life . If you 're looking for a nice theatrical effect , skip it and watch something else.<br /><br />But if you 're looking for camp - value , this is it . Here 's my advice : <unk> a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it .
I can imagine why he 'd want to die , after starring in this rubbish . The man is incredible , but even Sidney <unk> could n't save this tiresome morality play about racism in the old West . He and Joanna Going are both fantastic in this film : too bad the screenplay , co - stars , directing , and score could n't match those two .
This was a dreadful , boring movie , even for a documentary . At times , it did provided insight to life and also had humorous moments , but overall it was not worth seeing . Every time I began to feel sympathetic towards Mark and began to hope he would be successful , I would become disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse .
This is definitely one of the weaker of the series of Carry On films . It lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue . By the time this came out , the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show ! If you 're coming fresh to this series , avoid this one till near the end .
This could have been a very good film , a very interesting look at ancient tradition and oral history , but it should have been a short subject . As it is , it moves at a snail 's pace ; sure that 's part of the life being portrayed , but this was unbearable . I fell asleep watching them make soup and that was a highlight .
I guess I have to write something here , although I think my one summary says it all . I 'm not a huge Ted <unk> fan ... nothing against the man , just has n't " done it " for me . This covers the sides of Swift 's novel that were never covered before . You can tell the cast was having a wonderful time filming this .
... but it 's still an entertaining TV movie . The <unk> to the Civil War makes a nice change of pace , and adds a few <unk> ( such as Ariel 's <unk> to <unk> / <unk> ) that you might not otherwise see . Thankfully , they did n't try to make it a mini - series : at 90 minutes , it 's just about right .
Scary in places though the effects did leave something to be desired unless you have bad <unk> or are afraid of the dark . However most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well done . I thought the creature looked a bit too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my liking . It reminded me of the original pink <unk> film .
I 'm glad Cage changed his name from <unk> and got this part on his own . Light - hearted , no deep thought needed , but a cute piece about <unk> <unk> though her parents are still hippies .... <unk> the voice of the early <unk> the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side . One can see the beginning of Cage 's talent .
this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better . <unk> is protecting an inventor in <unk> and is on the trail of professor <unk> , who has become a nazi . this is a better version of <unk> in a WWII world . <unk> does a great job with <unk> as a spy and a detective . see this if you liked the voice of terror .
For the most part , romance films were never my cup of tea . But Valley Girl is one of the few romance films I not only could sit through , but actually enjoy . Nicholas Cage is great in his first role and Deborah <unk> is cute beyond belief . There are some side stories that tend to become muddled , but not enough to diminish this film .
This mostly routine fact - based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole . This is the story of a highly trained military man , unhappy with his wife and children , <unk> his demise and runs off with the other woman . To support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks . Predictable , but not a bad watch .
For all that has been said about the subject matter , and the controversy that surrounded it , please do not overlook what I feel to be the most important part of the film : the <unk> struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials . Whether dealing with self - imposed male <unk> , a sexual <unk> , or even life itself , everybody is human .
This program was quite interesting . The way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting . <unk> Theory is also very interesting to listen too . The whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it . I enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the <unk> . <unk> dimensions really <unk> the mind . If you have the chance , watch this amazing documentary .
As a native of the city where the story takes place , Buffalo , NY , it 's fun to see the local sites but the story line is so local and fun , <unk> /><br />The small scale promoting of this film requires strong word of mouth to accomplish the wide viewing it deserves . Please make this film the success the Big , Fat Greek Wedding was .
<unk> effective horror / science - fiction a la " Alien " is fairly well done given its limited ambitions . Some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue . When a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total <unk> .
As a history of Custer , this <unk> even close ( Custer dies to help the <unk> ? I am sure the other members of the 7th <unk> were n't <unk> in THAT decision . ) But as a western , this is fun . Flynn looks , and acts , the part of the dashing <unk> . And the " Garry Owen " is always nice to hear !
Two Hands restored my faith in Aussie films . It took an old premise and made it fresh . I enjoyed this movie to no end . I recommend it to those people who like Guy Ritchie films . Bryan Brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him . Ledger was <unk> dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me .
After my 6 year old daughter began taking riding lessons I started looking for horse movies for her . I had always heard of National Velvet but had never seen it . Boy am I glad I bought it ! It 's become a favorite of mine , my 6 year old AND my 2 year old . It 's a shame movies like this are n't made anymore .
John Cusack stars as <unk> in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies . Believe it or not Demi Moore is his co star ... If you love the eighties , grew up around that time , or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh . Wait until you see the cartoons .. what a riot ....
Bad sequels ..... this one 's a real one ! When the first movie was very very bad , you have to be fool to make a sequel ..... Worse actors , worse scenario , worse special effects , worse movie ! ! ! This is history ! Bad history ! I give it 0 and a half ( for laughs ) out of * * * * * .
Tim Curry was the reason I wanted to see this film , and while of course his appearance is always entertaining , he 's basically wasted in it . The rest of the cast does n't fare too well either , in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary . To quote a popular <unk> , sometimes less is more .
Life is too short to waste on two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this , unless you 're a clueless <unk> 16 year old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do . Dull characters , poor acting ( artificial emotion ) , weak story , slow pace , and most important to this films flawed existence - no one cares about the overly dramatic relationship .
A girl is looking for her soul <unk> this movie was very <unk> lots of sequences that look like an hallucinations . Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable one in the picture . It was hard to figure out what the director was trying to <unk> Most of the time the main character is dressed in weird clothes and makeup . A weird combination of reality and madness .
This is probably the worst film I have ever seen ; it makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look wonderful . The acting is wooden , the plot silly and the SFX non - existent . The only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film . The scenery is sometimes quite pretty , assuming you like trees , if that helps any !
Very shortly : a bad film . If you are looking for pure action and no brain ( or brain ' illusion ' ) or you are under 15 years old and like Bruce Willis this is THE movie . Also , do n't expect the scenario to be consistent or even <unk> if you think a little , so do n't if you just want to enjoy yourself .
I saw this movie over 20 years ago and had rather fond memories of it . <unk> again on Cinemax this month , I realized how little <unk> I had about films back then . This is an utterly ordinary spaghetti western , with absolutely nothing noteworthy about it . Script , direction , acting , photography are all a big blah . Stick with the Sergio Leone westerns !
I loved it , it was really gruesome and disgusting . I thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly <unk> . the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about Jesus Christ was really interesting . The tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome . Do n't watch this if you have a weak heart , you would n't be able to stand it .
I think that just sums up this film . Watch it and you 'll find out why . The acting of the lead character John <unk> is really , really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever . It 's very funny because of this thought , as is the ending where <unk> <unk> the bad guy despite the fact he is unarmed and has surrendered . Brilliant !
I agree with Vince , this movie paved the way for Goodfellas . The scene where Pesci was throwing peanuts at the piano player reminded me of his " How am I funny ? " routine in Goodfellas . This is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention . As with many other mob films , the theme of The Death Collector rings true : Always respect the Don .
This film is well cast , often silly and always funny . Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection . Brent <unk> is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director . From the first " <unk> <unk> " to the last " you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two <unk> " , I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy
Billy and Jade had a very close relationship that went to far one evening even though Billy was sleeping with Jade 's mother . Jade has to deal with the fact that her mother may never know and that it will never happen again . Billy is played by Rob Estes who could n't have looked better . Lifetime tv has made another movie that everyone is bound to like .
<unk> them to the <unk> . This is the solution two <unk> find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh . An incredible story with humor and possible <unk> that make it much more than a horror film . The complex characters defy superficial <unk> and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it . Definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive .
I ca nt see how some people ca nt find this film funny i saw the end of it on Sky Movies in 2001 thought i would by the DVD since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like <unk> <unk> laugh " <unk> " and <unk> " Hello night <unk> " when they never get any phone calls overall i think this film is very very funny .
Fun bad movie which should amuse . One of Joan Crawford 's last performances as the driven successful editor vs. all those young beautiful eager <unk> fresh out of the elite Seven Sister <unk> . Great ' 50 's ambiance of New York . Wonderful period costumes and <unk> . <unk> art direction . <unk> story , but <unk> tearjerker . Interesting cameo by Robert Evans as a rich cad .
Wonderfully funny , awe - inspiring feature on the pioneers of <unk> . DJ Shadow and Q - Bert are amazing in this terrific documentary . Check out just about every major DJ <unk> their getting in to scratch thanks to Herbie <unk> 's post - <unk> classic ' <unk> ' , and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind - blowing <unk> routines of all time .
This film by <unk> <unk> , director of Children of Nature , is powerful . It has great music by <unk> and good acting . It shows how sad insanity as a disease can be . There are many good jokes but the humor is dark . If that is not a problem then you should see this film . Note though this is not a comedy but a drama .
I do n't know what it is about the crew from <unk> , but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity . Haggard is so incredibly dumb and funny that it 's almost comedic excellence . Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense , but who <unk> /><br />It made me laugh my ass off . A must - have for the <unk> / Jackass aficionado !
I saw this movie on the base movie theater while in the Air Force so my affection for it might be influenced by the reaction of the <unk> audience in attendance at the theater that night . But I do think that this movie was one of the first popular kung - fu movies and helped to begin the trend in the early 70 's . It 's worth seeing .
A delightful story about two <unk> , has been turned into a nice little film , by the BBC . Most children who like a good story will enjoy this . The characters are played really well by a very good cast . Not sure whether our American friends will appreciate it , but they do get a mention , as <unk> Lou runs off with a gorgeous American soldier .
This movie is <unk> a horror movie and if you do not get scared than you must not be watching this movie . It works on the old techniques but throws something new into the mix . This movie grips and runs and hides within your mind . The movie has a point to it unlike other horror movies . Watch it for a thrill and shock to your system .
This film is great with some of the best songs <unk> by Bon Jovi and kiss . The film is about a man named <unk> <unk> is the biggest fan of a band named Steel Dragon . And then when he gets the gig for lead singer his world changes upside down . With great acting by Jennifer Aniston this film is a must see for rock <unk> /><br <unk> stars
I really liked this film - not so much for the story ( which was okay , but was a bit slow - moving in spots ) but <unk> for the incredibly beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek <unk> ! Susan Sarandon is utterly engaging as the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes - a man " on the edge " . But the scenery ! Oh oh oh !
I thought I was going to watch another Friday The 13th or a Halloween rip off , But I was surprised , It 's about 3 psycho kids who kill , There 's not too many movies like that , I can think of <unk> , Children Of The Corn and a few others , It 's not the greatest horror movie but it 's a least worth a rent .
This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a <unk> <unk> called upon to ' <unk> ' an autobiography of a colorful , <unk> Hollywood <unk> Rooney ) . At times silliness becomes obnoxious . This is not Cain at his best . Rooney is way over the top . Notable support from <unk> Scott , Lionel <unk> and the comely Nadia <unk> . Not easy to watch .
The worst movie i 've seen in years ( and i 've seen a lot of movies ) . Acting is terrible , there is no plot whatsoever , there is no point whatsoever , i felt robbed after i rented this movie . they recommended it to me mind you ! a disgrace for terrible movies ! stay away from this terrible piece of <unk> . save your money !
This miniseries / movie was so terrible at times that I nearly broke down and turned it off . I am a great fan of the novel , however this movie suffers from <unk> of problems . The costuming is poor , and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are <unk> . The <unk> from the novel are poorly chosen , significant nuances are missed or <unk> /><br / >
A bad bad movie ... terrible plot , hinges on <unk> <unk> 's <unk> , but he speaks maybe 20 words in the entire movie and only has one fight scene - still in great shape considering he was also in the kung fu classic " Enter The Dragon " Interesting to see William <unk> ( " Johnny " from The Karate Kid ) in another martial - arts role .
Seagal was way off the mark with this film . I 'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this , instead it had <unk> and cheesy music . Even if you 're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead .
Storyline drags . Drug <unk> a Beautiful women and a determined cop . Nothing not already done a hundred times before . The boat <unk> will be well worth the wait Amsterdam is the perfect city to pull it off . The <unk> and <unk> put you on the edge of your seat . I would say the same as did the car chase in <unk> , very intense ! .
George Hilton never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood , but this is a great outing for him . Basically <unk> off the Django / man With No Name and doing a damn good job . The opening sequence of this gem is a classic , and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch . Fans of the genre will be in heaven .
This is a wonderful thriller I watched many times and never can get enough of . It 's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for <unk> in Paris , ( <unk> coincidences , false identities . The music makes it really gripping . There are hardly any flaws in the characters , just the end is not very credible , but a definite " must - see " still .
<unk> is one of the best movies I 've seen about The <unk> Arts . The music and the acting are excellent . The screenplay and Set Design are also excellent . My favorite part is when all the students start Dancing and making music in the <unk> . I can see this movie any number of times , and never get bored . I give it 8 1/2 on 10 .
A " sleeper " . I had never even heard of this movie until I was channel jumping one night . I 've been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie . Non - police critics are rating the movie purely from a critic 's point of view and not from a police officer 's point of view . This is real .
with what they had . John and <unk> were very private so the writers had to put together what they could . I really liked <unk> de Rossi as <unk> , but Jacqueline <unk> 's voice <unk> on my nerves . She should have used her regular voice . I would have preferred that the whole movie focus on John and <unk> instead of rehashing stuff we already know about John .
The premise is rather original and well thought - of , but unfortunately , <unk> a good story is very low budget that does n't even allow for decent special effects . Jeff Fahey does his best amongst a poor cast , as does the always beautiful Linda Hoffman . They should make more movies together . The movie , while not worth much praise , warrants at least one viewing .
When I saw this movie at age 6 , it was in the <unk> ' section at <unk> Video because it was animation . We watched it and it was a whole different ball game ! A very violent story and graphic deaths are VERY entertaining and compelling , but not for children . Avoid for family viewing , my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart !
If it was n't meant to be a comedy , the filmmakers sure <unk> . If they intended for it to be a comedy , they hit the mark . Our critic says <unk> is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit , <unk> it for all audiences , and says that he really liked Jamie Lee Curtis 's performance . It deserves a theatrical re - release .
This has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it 's exposure of the injustices of bigotry . Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as <unk> / White Wolf . However , felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes . This is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring .
The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film <unk> as good as the shower scene in Psycho ) and the acting by Robert Walker is fantastic . A psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders . <unk> the story and overall this film is very good but there s one problem : why <unk> Guy Haines go to < br /><br />the cop in the first <unk>
What a crazy <unk> lasts 12 ( ! ) hours and you do n't understand who these people are and what are they <unk> main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene " <unk> there are lots of sub - plots , like the disappearing of Thomas and a crazy guy looking for <unk> <unk> .... what 's the meaning of all this ? ? ?
This was a rather unnerving look at an ostensibly functional family confronted by their daughter 's <unk> boyfriend . Father <unk> with and ultimately kills <unk> boyfriend . <unk> in guilt he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done . Things spiral rapidly out of hand before <unk> completely . The ending you dread stalks the viewer throughout , but is still able to <unk> when it finally arrives .
Messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish . The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways . <unk> Red <unk> ( Ken <unk> to find the truth which , to his surprise , is a little closer to home than he might think.<br /><br <unk> drama and Ken <unk> was brilliant . Hopefully we have not seen the last of <unk> Red <unk> .
This is one of the anime films from The <unk> collection , one of nine - the only one done in black and white , and the only one featuring Trinity . <unk> textured and beautifully rendered in every way , and the animated version of Trinity definitely does her justice . If you 're a fan of The Matrix , you will need to put this on your short list .
Absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story . Told with unflinching eye and with gripping style . If you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people , this could change your mind . Something for you <unk> too : A good model for government <unk> ! If you like your news all tidy and easy to <unk> this is not for you .
This movie is very scary with scenes where the Devil uses <unk> horn to open Heaven and pull the good angel - dogs out and <unk> them on <unk> . The devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad , and at one point , eats a live <unk> /><br />We got this movie free with a pizza . You get what you pay for .
<unk> is insipid and unconvincing , Kline over - acts as always , as does Lithgow while butchering an English accent ( at least , I assume that 's what he 's attempting ) , and the tone staggers <unk> between farcical and maudlin . As with most pet projects showcasing a celebrity couple , it 's a relief when this shoddy piece grinds to it 's forced and jarring conclusion .
This movie is very scary with scenes where the Devil uses <unk> horn to open Heaven and pull the good angel - dogs out and <unk> them on <unk> . The devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad , and at one point , eats a live <unk> /><br />We got this movie free with a pizza . You get what you pay for .
Some famous stories are prone to being moved to another <unk> and , as such , becoming an embarrassing TV - movie . Oscar Wilde 's <unk> Ghost is one of them . This TV movie for kids is utterly cheap , concerning acting , character work , credibility , directing and even concerning the modest special effects . As often , the question arises : what was this made for ?
The only good thing about this film is they managed to tie it with Part one ! But other than that it was one of the worst films ever ! The only time you see the <unk> is in a flashback ( and the flashback is just clips from Part one ) ! A must NOT see ! On a One to Ten , " <unk> 4 " gets a One !
This is so blatantly a made - for - TV ripoff of Black Widow ( 1987 ) - even the insect titles are so <unk> /><br />If you want a better " marrying for money " movie , check out Black Widow , starring Debra Winger & Theresa <unk> /><br />These movie is cheesiness at its best .. ! I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended .
Let 's just say that it might be the worst movie I 've ever seen . On the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling <unk> Dogs . I fell for it hook , line , and <unk> . This is just a warning message to anyone who might read this . It 's not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at .
By Randolph Scott standards of the 1950s , this is a disappointing and heavy - handed star western . Two or three of the characters could be <unk> with , while two or three other characters could be given more prominence . ( The humour needs to be completely <unk> . ) De <unk> handles the action well - as always - but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak .
I just ca nt see what everyone sees in this movie . The acting is just awful , the choice of music is , mildly putting it , peculiar , there are nt enough fighting scenes , the plot is non - existent and whatever small entertainment one could get from this film is ruined by the annoying way some of the movie is filmed and gives you a splitting <unk> .
Most of Wayne 's B westerns are kind of fun in a naive way , but this one really stinks . The editing is terrible , and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic . Most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper , and I was bored . Sorry , Duke , but this gets a 1 .
There are films that are not released in theaters but on video . This one should be allowed to age and <unk> the way old <unk> film stock does . No story , inept violence , over acted , badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film . And I did like and enjoyed some of Siegel 's other movies .
I love Stephen Kings work and the book was great but I was very disappointed when I bought this movie on DVD . This was one of the worst B - movies I have ever seen . It feels like they had a tight schedule and only took one shot at every scene even if it turned out to be a bad one . And where did they find the actors .
I saw this movie only because Sophie <unk> . However , her acting abilities it 's no enough to <unk> this movie . Almost all cast do n't play their character well , exception for Sophie and Frederic . The plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places . I saw several good french movies but this one i do n't like .
As long as you can get past your <unk> instincts and realize that <unk> are people too , you 'll realize the depth <unk> . <unk> gives to his characters . Also , an incredible soundtrack . The songs are so tightly tied to their scenes , you wo n't be able to hear them without thinking about the movie again.<br /><br <unk> Seymour Hoffman is worth the price of admission alone .
The most striking feature about this well acted film , is the almost surreal < br /><br <unk> of the era and time it was shot it . I could sense the time and moments were stark and very real . Even the language was so well chosen . It 's all too often when <unk> of today 's world are carelessly used in movies about < br /><br <unk> time and place
This movie was a pleasant surprise for me . In all honesty , the previews looked horrible , up until the point where Emma Thompson and Alan <unk> appeared . So I rented it with reservation , but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie . It had great acting , a few good plot twists , and , of course , Emma Thompson and Alan <unk> . It 's definitely worth checking out .
Loved this movie ! ! Great acting by Carla <unk> . Interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong ( do n't they all ? ) . Some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible . It was a totally unexpected delight . More " Quentin - ish " than most films try to be .
If you want to see a film with no guns , blood , sex , shouting angry people , hero , bad guys & girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of " LOVE " , this one is a must see film . For me I 've been waiting for a film like this all of my life .
Surprisingly good " Mean <unk> crime drama . <unk> elements of " Goodfellas " and " Casino " . Joe Pesci 's first big role . Clever dialog . I think the Maltin guide gives this a bomb rating . I can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it.<br /><br <unk> this at Tarantino 's film fest and he said Scorsese used a number of these actors in Raging Bull .
Ms. Stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who <unk> a children 's author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state 's . This is an incredibly powerful film . Both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie . Put this on your must see list if you can locate it .
<unk> hearted flic depicting arch - angel Michael as a <unk> , overweight , cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and <unk> with the opposite sex . He does have a good side , however , as he strives to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven . Funny , well played out film ; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent .
In this Dream - Come - True , I found myself loving what was going on . It 's a good movie , and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie . It 's too smart for that . It 's definitely a feel good movie , but with a nice message to leave you with . 7/10 , B , * * 1/2 out of * * * *
Tom <unk> uses " <unk> <unk> " in his book " Red Storm Rising " . In the book , <unk> was show in theatres across Russia as a <unk> to the Soviet invasion of West Germany . I felt I had to check it out . It was <unk> ! The cinematography was magnificent and storyline incredible . I do not regret watching this movie and added in to my collection .
Poorly directed short " film " ( shot on hi - <unk> or <unk> it appears ) . It screams student film / video all the way . The premise is limited in scope and the short actually feels a lot longer than it runs . Some interesting acting moments and some decent production value , but not enough to lift this film from " the hole " it has fallen into .
I knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of air time . The story line : Two people get married . They move into the wife 's parents home . And husband does n't get along with father - in - law - and if you have n't seen this plot before you probably have not watched TV for the last 15 years or so .
Leon Errol handles his double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil <unk> superbly , but I have trouble liking the " Mexican <unk> " Series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities , and these are telegraphed way in advance . Errol is funny as the stuffy Lord <unk> , but I would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition . < br /><br / >
I 'm a big fan of Kevin Spacey 's work , but this is a sub - standard film . If you think it looks interesting , or you saw it and liked it , go and check out John Boorman 's " The General " . It is basically about the same guy , but is far superior in every way ( and does n't suffer from the Hollywood <unk> ) .
I was pleasantly surprised with this one . It 's actually quite interesting and engaging . The cast is strong , even Dan <unk> . Brooke Shields has come into her own as an actress . Black and White must have really set her free , 'cause I have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character . If marketed right , could be a medium - size hit .
A clever overall story / location for a story . Action is respectable . The children are annoying and their motivation is unclear . The leading villain was a nice change but could have been better . " I Love You " was more overplayed than " you complete me " but at least Van Damme got a chance to show a little tenderness . One of Van Damme 's better movies .
I saw this Film one midnight and I can say that it worse than other horror film about a Haunted House . Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actress but she can do the role better , The little girl get worse this is a example about a Bad actress , she has not got future in the great world of films . <unk> FOR HOUSE OF THE <unk> : BAD
I laughed at the movie ! The script , the acting please do n't we deserve better ? But now the filming , some of the camera angles were interesting . I did enjoy the film , but it 's not to be taken seriously though . I liked it . If it had a new cast and <unk> it would be better than all right . It 's worth a look !
I saw this film because <unk> did the score . A real disappointment . Annoying , trendy scenes , with urban <unk> and their cliche hip lifestyles . Cheesy stereotypical Mexican border culture ( mystic grandfather with the <unk> and <unk> , granddaughter in her <unk> - style restaurant <unk> ) . A few laughs , but <unk> - than - thou , and sorely lacking in vision and basic filmmaking talent .
This may just be the worst movie of all time . Never have I seen such horrible film making before in my life . Its so bad I think I want to go watch Barney instead . I advise everyone who reads this to write a <unk> to get this movie off of our film history so we can never hear from it again . I give it 1 out of 10 .
It 's really too bad that John Candy wasted his skills on so many horrible films ( Delirious , <unk> East , Who 's Harry <unk> ? , etc .. This one has maybe a few chuckles , but it 's mostly just really bad one - liners and dumb physical stuff . Let 's honor this comedian 's memory by remembering things like <unk> , <unk> & <unk> and Uncle Buck .
<unk> through the channels I was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie . I must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately . I love older films and this is or should be considered a classic ! One of the most wonderful <unk> of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl . I highly recommend this movie !
I enjoyed this film very much . I found it to be very entertaining for me in that I feel that it captured the romanticism of turn of the century Irish - American culture . There 's no messages . There 's no violence and there 's no overt sex , just wholesome 1947 style entertainment and Dennis Morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs . A really good movie .
Those two main characters <unk> and Stefan are a <unk> comedy act . I was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing . But when I saw this movie I was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it.<br /><br />All in all very amusing and not a common german movie .
You got to love this movie ! I mean , what other Swedish splatter movie could be so evil , bizarre and totally cruel ... The whole movie is stuffed with some kind of weird humor , like : The old <unk> just blows his head off and the boss just wipes the blood off his glasses and says with a mean voice : - Your fired ! ! ! <unk> ! ! !
When I saw Gone with the wind I thought that there could not be better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and <unk> but then I saw the movie Scarlet . I fell in love for this dramatic story . I love Timothy Dalton as <unk> Butler , he 's fantastic . This is a movie I could watch a thousand times and it still would n't bore me .
The play is cleverly constructed - begin with the <unk> , <unk> - & let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes . The film follows the play with great faithfulness , working , no doubt , on the simple premise that it could n't be <unk> . Now throw in a host of superb character actors - & the result is a resounding triumph . A definite must - see .
I have fond memories of watching this when it came out . It 's one of those films that you know is rubbish , even when you 're a kid , but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting , special effects and plot ( so there 's a race of big - busted <unk> living underground , huh ? ) and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they 're worth .
I recently rented this video after seeing " Final <unk> " by the same writer . I was n't prepared for how intense this film would get . I found it engaging from start to finish , and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime . The ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence , but well - done . I highly recommend this picture .
This film shows a serious side to the often thought of as gore - fest works of <unk> . Not a lot of blood and guts here , but a fine tale about murder and the lives affected by it.<br /><br />A real find , considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th <unk> /><br />Check this one out , but be warned it is hard to <unk> /><br <unk>
The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film <unk> as good as the shower scene in Psycho ) and the acting by Robert Walker is fantastic . A psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders . <unk> the story and overall this film is very good but there s one problem : why <unk> Guy Haines go to the cop in the first <unk> < br /><br / >
The One and the <unk> /><br />The only really good description of the punk movement in the LA in the early 80 's . Also , the definitive documentary about legendary bands like the Black <unk> and the X. <unk> Americans ' repugnant views about this film are absolutely hilarious ! How can music be SO <unk> in a country of supposed liberty ... even 20 years after ... find out!<br /><br / >
A beautiful , sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so - called reasons . The performance of Cage and Cruz were quite impressive , but it is to the older Greek characters that go the highest praises . Irene Papas is as gorgeous as ever ! Though some scenes seems a little long at times , this film will be a heavy Oscar contender .
" Bar <unk> " seems to be trying to be about the stereotypical bar tender and lay " shrink " serving up <unk> of wisdom followed by example vignettes played out by the cast . However , this turkey is a jumbled mess with a script full of simple - minded cliched nonsense : Hard to follow , <unk> - jerky flow , unsatisfying , and not worth the time . ( D )
Considering the subject matter , I thought that this film would at least be enjoyable , if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece . I was wrong . I was still waiting for something to happen and it finished - I thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting . The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition .
Stone has tried another type of movie . Any Given Sunday falls short of a the above average The Last Boy <unk> and the below average Against all <unk> . Stone can be fantastic , see The Doors , Natural Born Killers or Platoon but he can also repeat himself see Nixon or Born on the Fourth of July . His real brilliance is realized in the Michael Caine perfection , The Hand .
This is a candidate for worst films I 've ever seen . It wanted to be as shocking as " Silence of the Lambs , " but has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned . The make - up is excellent , the acting is pretty good , but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so gruesome that they 're more disturbing than entertaining .
A young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child . Both are disturbed about a two hour memory lapse on the night of conception . Interesting twist on an hackneyed story . Very good F / X and interesting editing . <unk> <unk> is outstanding in a cast that features Arnold Vosloo , Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif . Brimley brings normalcy to the outlandish . Kudos to director Brian Yuzna .
Similar story line , done many times before , and this was no <unk> /><br <unk> minutes into this , and you should pretty much be able to turn it off - the ending was deja vu all over again.<br /><br />The only morals I could see out of this are : - stupidity + criminals do not equal success - if he screwed you before , he 's gon na do it again
Two things -- too long and totally lacked credibility . This movie did n't make any sense and was <unk> to sit through . I am usually pretty patient , but man ... It just does n't keep your attention at all ! I think I am being nice here even ! You keep thinking it 's almost over only to find out it 's still got another half hour ! Good actors .
This is a great premise for a movie . The overall plot is very original , interesting , and something to think about . However poor production , an obviously small budget , <unk> acting from the main character , and several side actors really detract from this would be classic . An up and coming producer should try to <unk> this story and give this <unk> half hearted <unk> a proper release .
The Comic Strip featured actors from ' The Young One 's ' - a student based sitcom from the 80 's . Comic Strip features included parodies of westerns , ' The famous 5 ' , and The <unk> - all a lot funnier than this . Having said that <unk> <unk> puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era . 5/10
I 'm normally a fan of Mel Gibson , but in this case he did a movie with a poor script . The acting for the most part really was n't that bad , but the story was just pointless with flaws and boring . I thought I would like the movie a little but I did n't like it at all actually . I give it a 1 1/2 out of 5 !
If you are a <unk> Shore fan , you will laugh your butt off . If not , this is a silly mess wasting some very good talent . A cute <unk> <unk> South Dakota invites her California college dorm <unk> ) home to share Thanksgiving . Notable cast members : Lane Smith , Cindy <unk> , Mason Adams and the drop dead gorgeous <unk> - Amber <unk> . Watch where you step .
I 've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good . Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act . She appears occasionally in soft core such as " Body of Love " and " Lady <unk> 's Stories " on Showtime . I thought Nicole <unk> did OK too with her nice body and charming accent . Too bad she 's not in more films .
The largest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the US took place at <unk> 6 . Over <unk> people showed up to break the Rolling Stones indoor record , and this event did n't disappoint at all . Maybe the biggest match of all time took place as the <unk> Hulk defended his world title against the Ultimate Warrior . There are over 12 matches in all so you get tons of action
This movie literally had me rolling on the floor ( well at least on the couch ) laughing . I did n't think I would like it , but it came on cable TV one afternoon , and I watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself . Since then , I 've also seen Black <unk> , which was pretty good , but not as non - stop - funny as Tommy Boy .
I loved this . It starts out as a fairly normal , slightly ponderous French art movie and then all of a sudden , halfway through it 's turned on it 's head . This part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one . Sadly , the ending does n't make much sense , which is a great shame . Oh yes , and it 's brilliantly filmed .
I had always wanted to see this film and the first three - <unk> proved I had n't waited in vain . But what the hell happened in the end ? I mean , do n't get me wrong , I liked the film . It definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic , unique NYC of the 80s that we have lost thanks to <unk> . But it 's missing another half hour !
Very violent and nicely filmed movie . <unk> is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too . This movie has lots of black humor . This guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster . There will be sometimes when you would n't know whether to shiver or to smile and think " Am I laughing at someone who is killing people ? "
< br /><br />my favorite science fiction , incredible ride through <unk> and the <unk> of reality . Probably the best performance I have ever seen Jude Law play . Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully <unk> its genius . Even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning .
It may be a remake of the 1937 film by Capra , but it is wrong to consider it only in that way ! It was supposed to expose Hilton 's novel in a completely different way . As a musical is excellent . The scenery is terrific , the characters good and anyone like " Leonard Maltin " who considers the <unk> music awful must be completely deaf ! I strongly recommend it .
Because it 's late and i 'm running short on vocabulary , i will describe this film as " beautiful and heartbreaking , " begging the forgiveness of those who cringe at such cliches . Robin <unk> does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the clutches of <unk> 's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing , and i will follow her career wherever it goes because of this film .
A widely unknown strange little western with <unk> colours ( probably the same material as it was used in " Johnny <unk> " , I guess " <unk> " or something , which makes blood <unk> look like shining <unk> ) , nearly surrealistic scenes with twisted action and characters . Something different , far from being a masterpiece , but there should be paid more attention to this little gem in western <unk> .
Admittedly , I am not a fan of the Monogram Chan films . . The plot , involving <unk> theft from a bank vault , is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that Fox produced . <unk> <unk> and Benson Fong ( as No . 3 Son Tommy ) provide some laughs as usual . But otherwise there is n't much here . Great title that is wasted .
What can I say after I say the one line summary . Sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it ca n't save it . Way too much pre occupation with guns . How can the Hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns ? ? It 's just worse than expected .
The worst film ever , with characters from Carnosaur 1 - 3 inserted merely to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film , so that footage and special effects could be <unk> /><br <unk> away from this <unk> /><br <unk> is ruining his legacy . He made and produced some amazing films - but that era ended with Carnosaur being his last " creative in its badness " film .
A day in the life of a dimwitted cab driver sometime around Christmas : The cab driver picks up a fare ... they have a ' really insightful ' interlude ... he drops off the fare ... he picks up another fare ... another interlude ... and so it goes on like this for 90 friggin ' minutes ... none of it convincing ( or interesting ) for even one minute ... <unk> IT !
This movie features some of the best ensemble work I 've seen in film or on stage . The actors play off each other with a skill and <unk> that in no way can be achieved through editing.<br /><br <unk> Jones " a good story , period . But it is also an excellent portrayal of the urban , middle - income , twenty - something African - American set that is not often seen .
Fantastic movie ! One of the best film noir movies ever made . Bad guys , bad girls , a jewel heist , a twisted morality , a kidnapping , everything is here . Jean <unk> has a face that would make Bogart proud and the rest of the cast is is full of character actors who seem to to know they 're onto something good . Get some popcorn and have a great time .
I first saw this film on <unk> around 1983 and I loved it ! I <unk> all of the auction web sites to buy the <unk> copy . This is a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting . I do n't want to say too much else because if you ever get a chance to see it , you 'll be glad I did n't say too much !
This is a very sweet coming - of - age movie , very funny , and Russell Crowe is amazing ! Those who know him only from Gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities . Arthur <unk> ( his character ) is one of the best onscreen nerdy virgins I have ever <unk> Watch this movie -- how can we get it re - released in <unk> <unk> /><br / >
<unk> <unk> is a cinematic survey of Gypsy music from several countries . It is touching , sad and joyous . Most of the segments appear to be completely <unk> , <unk> . The music , ranging from the sensual flamenco music of the Spanish <unk> , to the melancholy music of the Central European <unk> , is exquisite . If you love Gypsy music , you 'll find <unk> <unk> absolutely beautiful.<br /><br / >
The brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process , which is a conventional , but executed , intertwining tale of the lies of three <unk> post WWII , but in the fact that this story was told at all . Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the <unk> to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with <unk> for hands , an alcoholic , and an <unk> .
i loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of American working class society and <unk> life in the first half of the 20th century . i was drawn in by the timeless <unk> of this realistic performance . see and feel the star power . melancholic " <unk> " comedy . Anybody in the mood for a shot with a beer <unk> ... or a little <unk> ? Hey , <unk> ! !
I missed it at the cinema and have rented it on DVD . If you get the chance I would recommend it as it´s better than nearly everything <unk> seen at the cinema or on <unk> this year . That <unk> to say it´s one of the best films ever or anything , it´s just <unk> seen a lot of rubbish : ) < br /><br <unk> really add to <unk> already been said except 8/10
I guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term " cult flick " . It is totally a bad movie , but I ca n't help it , I like this movie . Richard Boone has made better and so has Joan Van Arc , but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that do n't make you think to much this one is for you .
This is a must for All but especially African Americans . It is about time there is a movie that expresses and shows the concerns going on in African American relationships . It also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous manner how positive African American relationships are and the outcomes of them instead of the undesirable stereotype that plagues the African American community . I love this film a must see ! !
The story of dirty fat filth - like middle - age woman who lives out of society be knowing as the <unk> woman ever lived . Can someone take her the crown ? There is one couple ..... The nice film for people who do n't like ordinary pieces of comedies and do n't mind some disturbing sense of humor . I was very surprised seeing some scenes and love theirs <unk> kind.<br /><br / >
An intense thriller about a mute movie make - up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night . After she tries to get away from the murder scene , she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness . This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat .
... in a TV - movie 70 's kind of way . It 's one of those movies that show up in the wee hours , but rarely because more modern late - hour schlock movies bump it off . It has likeable performances by <unk> and Wynn . Generally , it 's just a harmless little piece of nothing that does n't offend too badly . Nothing good , a lot that 's mediocre .
Bad , bad , bad . How do movies like this get made ? Badly written , poorly acted ; I could go on , but why bother ? As an aside , note that the characters ' first names are the same as the actors playing them : this is a dead <unk> that no one on the set is even interested enough in their role to bother learning someone else 's characters names !
Even though I have great interest in Biblical movies , I was bored to death every minute of the movie . Everything is bad . The movie is too long , the acting is most of the time a <unk> and the script is horrible . I did not get the point in mixing the story about Abraham and Noah together . So if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror .
Martin Lawrence is not a funny man i <unk> . He just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which trips his puns pretty early in the game . He tries to make fun of critics , which boils down to " f * * * them " . Then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on <unk> with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there . 3/10
A low - rent , cheaply made police thriller that 's kept bearable by some fair humorous bits , the nice chemistry between the two leads and , especially , by James <unk> 's satisfying turn as a narcissistic , psychopathic ( and , naturally , indestructible ) villain . Obviously a low - quality picture , both visually and dramatically , with a rather resigned Burt , but not unwatchable . ( * * )
As a child growing up in the Sydney of the 1950s , I can readily identify with the content of this fine film . Each week I visited the <unk> <unk> cinema on George Street to watch the <unk> ( and usually 3 Stooges ) shorts . Never has there been a better blending of B / W and colour in a film . <unk> production values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience .
I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor <unk> . The primary actors ( Campbell Scott , Jennifer Beals , <unk> Butler , James <unk> III , Patrick Stewart , and Leslie Caron ) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence . It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD . A rare gem .
I do n't think the world was ready for this film . I know I was n't . I 'd been expected a standard low - budget schlock exploitation potboiler . Instead , I got the most intelligent reworking of Shakespeare since Peter Greenaway 's " <unk> 's Books " . This should become the definitive film version of Romeo And Juliet . It wo n't of course . But that 's the world 's loss .
This is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare , besides that it 's a lot of fun.<br /><br <unk> Wars is the only good spoof on Star Wars , other films like <unk> have failed . This is the only good spoof film I have ever seen , it does n't rip - off Star Wars , it makes fun of it , and that 's what spoofs are supposed to be .
Wish it would be released , as I would love to see the finished product ! We saw the unfinished version before it came out . Loved all the characters and actors . Anyone know if it is out on video yet ? Would love to see it again . Definitely worth renting if it 's not going to be shown in the theatre . I had a hard time finding it because they renamed it .
I switched this on ( from cable ) on a whim and was treated to quite a surprise ... although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable ... no big stars but well - directed and just plain fun . With all the over - hyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then ... and this little film fits the bill nicely . 9/10
How to summarize this film ? it is simply impossible . Why you should see it ? maybe for the story , very probably for the actors ( Giorgio , Catherine ... ) , above all for the universe and the poetry . This is a tale . Sad , sometimes dark , but a tale . I LOVE this film ! ! ! ! Just waiting for the DVD ! ! Thank you <unk> <unk> .
That pretty much sums it up ... corny . MacDowell 's inability to act is at times painful , and Hurt must need money to take such muted roles , but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />Why ? In a single word , Travolta . He is GREAT in this movie . Still , I ca n't give the movie too high a score , but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting .
If you want to see a true thriller , rent this ! ! ! It 's not from the director or screenwriter of " Scream " , does n't feature overacting , <unk> " TV " actors passing off as " stars " , and is not a run of the mill special effects <unk> . Instead you 'll get a top - notch , edgy , very strong ( in violence ) yet thrilling <unk> .
This is supposed to be based on <unk> Collins ' _ <unk> _ , but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters ' names , the time period , and the settings . If they were going to change the story so thoroughly , I do n't understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from <unk> Collins . Go read the book . It 's much better .
For a horror film , this is criminally dull . A few memorable , gruesome bits ca n't compensate for a really poor script . Very little coherence is achieved , and the movie relentlessly <unk> its one basic idea ( a killer cat ) , until it becomes repetitive - and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the cat 's point - of - view . ( * 1/2 )
This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller , but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script , which was mostly used up in the beginning . After that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through . The movie followed a descending curve from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it concluded . It 's not recommended .
Awful , dreadful , terrible . The actors are bad , the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic . I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end.<br /><br />My advice : read the book , it is much better and you wo n't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams Catherine <unk> /><br />I think I have never watched such a bad movie .
Should I have expected anything other than putrid from Carrot Top ? This was on of the worst movies I have ever seen . It is by far the worst comedy I have ever seen . " Chairman of the Board " did not add humor to my attitude , rather it enraged me . That 's right , Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I became enraged that this man is making movies .
I have to admit I was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box . So I popped it in the <unk> and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something good to happen . But of course , it never does . The makers of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch " Saving Private Ryan " . Maybe they would learn something .
This has to be one of , if not THE greatest Mob / Crime films of all time . Every thing about this movie is great , the acting in this film is of true quality ; Master P 's acting skills make you actually believe he is Italian ! The cinematography is excellent too , probably the best ever . This movie was great ; and I have the brain capacity of an earth worm .
Was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across Africa . It was far and away the worst film I have ever come across . <unk> to be the # 1 all - time worst ;-) No acting , no plot , very little speaking . Lots of ape - like <unk> though , in this hopelessly unlikely film . An <unk> self - satire - you 'll either laugh at it or cry .
Lots of flames , thousands of extras in battle scenes , lots of beautiful sets . I do n't think the plot supported such a vast <unk> . The story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid , psychologically if there were n't so much macho <unk> in the production . Chinese movies tend to be this way , in my experience . and I think this detracts from the film .
It was dumb . Sort of like an Adam Sandler movie . < br /><br />There were a few funny parts but not that funny.<br /><br />I liked some of the actors in it though . < br /><br />There were some <unk> . Night Live people in the movie . But I would n't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on . And it was still better than any Jennifer Lopez movie .
what was Bruce Willis thinking when he signed on for this one ? ? this one made no sense to me .. i was so confused by it , it was nt funny at all .. I do nt even know why Disney made this one .. Bruce is a Great actor whom i ve liked for a Long time .. and this disappointed me a lot .. Pass this one by on the video shelf ....
Having just seen this , I find it hard to believe that it is not better known . This and the slightly - better - known , but almost - as - shamefully - neglected COME AND SEE ( <unk> , 1986 ) must be two of the greatest war films . They are meaningful , powerful , <unk> . THE <unk> is also gifted with a <unk> - used , but brilliantly <unk> score by <unk> .
This film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying . I think it has got a decent horror plot and the acting seem normal to me . People are way over - <unk> what was wrong with this . It is simply classic horror , the type without a plot that we have to think about forever and forever . We can just sit back , relax , and be scared .
it was a very well written movie , and the actors had a very exquisite way of portraying all the character . but as the movie came to an end i felt as if there was more but they forgot to put it on the dvd . maybe they are planning on making a sequel ... well even if they do n't it 's a good movie and a good rental , but even a better purchase .
Seeing this movie always reminds me of what I remember summer being like , God ! such a long time ago . The entire scene involving the " overnight " , from the canoe <unk> to the end of the trip , is precious , and <unk> 's story about the homicidal maniac is urban legend right out of my youth . A highly entertaining movie , made many times better by the awful sequels that followed .
This is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time . We have been on a Keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films . In this one Buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about Buster - his creativity . The opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there .
Not the film to see if you want to be intellectually <unk> . If you want to have a lot of fun a the theater , however , this is the one . Lots of snappy <unk> some really cheesy banter , too ) . <unk> Def and Seth Green are very funny as the comic relief . <unk> and creative <unk> and chase scenes . Mark Wahlberg and Charlize <unk> appealing leads . And Donald Sutherland !
This is a whodunnit in the Hitchcock tradition . You are kept in the dark as suspects come and go . Dennis Quaid is <unk> as Dexter , a man doomed to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his babe . There is not much not to like in this little suspense and all the pieces fit neatly together the way they should . You wo n't be sorry you watched this one if you like suspense .
I watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it . I was very intriguing and suspenseful . It is amazing as the events unfold and this man 's past catches up with him.<br /><br />The acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims ... " twist of fate " ... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie .
<unk> and <unk> gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he 's found himself , only to find out that he 's not so sure he found the right guy . If you think that all gay comedies are the same , check this one out . Although the movie ends without much resolution , the hilarious one - liners , peculiar situations , and quirky characters are sure to satisfy .
Being a <unk> <unk> fan , I 've been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time . I recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable . It had some really hilarious scenes . The dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling , but I think the movie also showed that it 's possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it 's been <unk> .
I have n't seen the more recent ' Traffic ' which is based on this , but I 'd bet on this one as the better creation . I know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the ' war on drugs . " I 've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of Masterpiece Theatre 's 30th anniversary <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he 's found himself , only to find out that he 's not so sure he found the right guy . If you think that all gay comedies are the same , check this one out . Although the movie ends without much resolution , the hilarious one - liners , peculiar situations , and quirky characters are sure to satisfy .
<unk> 's " <unk> " , ( <unk> <unk> ) , is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era . <unk> was a pioneer of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day . The <unk> <unk> massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago . DO NOT pass up the chance to see this film !
A good story , well - acted with unexpected character twists eg . vicious murderous gangster Bryan Brown teaching his son <unk> . Although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy ( Ledger ) and his <unk> succeed , it also has some hilarious ironic black humour eg . the bank robbers who become radio competition " winners " and their reaction , the <unk> 's revenge etc . Well worth watching .
I was expecting this to be just like the others , tries to be <unk> ends up looking silly . Somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films . This feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the Child 's Play series . The new idea works making this the best in the series by far .
Seems to have been made as a vehicle for <unk> Fields and Carol <unk> and they dominate it . Fields already has his film character well developed . Carol <unk> seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of Mary Pickford , who also worked a long time under D.W. Griffith . Typical of later Griffith films <unk> /><br />Later remade as <unk> ( the original title ) with Fields in the same role .
Sadly a great opportunity to <unk> a superb cast to bring King <unk> up to date . However , instead , we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into <unk> when the writer had run out of ideas , the cast worked hard but it just did n't gel . Recently Stephen <unk> showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent TV movie " King of Texas " .
Robin Williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him . This may work if you buy into the " U - S - A ! Number One ! " mentality but story wise nothing much happens . Quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something , and says it sincerely . It just does n't pack enough emotional punch .
I know it 's not original , but what the hey ? What else can be said about it ? I feel <unk> silly just paying any attention at all to " From Hell It Came " . The movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and <unk> , not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time .
I found this film to be extremely homophobic ... the main character does n't know he 's gay until he realizes that he likes Barbra Streisand and has a limp wrist ! ! ! I was so offended that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival , I went up and spoke to the screen writer to complain about this film . This is the sort of film that <unk> needs to work to have banned .
Great story and great lead actors ( Quaid and Ryan ) but the movie suffers from bad directing , bad screenplay and bad script . The lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all . Too bad because this could have been a good 80 's style Hitchcock suspense / mystery / thriller . Ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though . An ok look for big Ryan fans .....
I do n't know if this exceptionally dull movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to ' The French <unk> " , but it does have many of the same drawbacks : the script is so confusing that the viewer remains <unk> and feels left out of the picture , and the direction is so cold , so lacking in energy , that even the great chase sequence ca n't liven things up . ( * 1/2 )
Obviously influenced by the success of Pal 's " Destination Moon " and <unk> 's " <unk> X - M " this one just does n't make the cut . <unk> special effects , a thin story line result in a production that even the half - decent cast ca n't save . Just no believability here . No one seems surprised to encounter Martians , much like <unk> , etc . etc . Pass on it !
Bad editing , bad production values , bad continuity , implausible , bad dialogue ... this movies is bad , bad , bad . However , if you want a movie to poke fun at ( a la <unk> ) , this is your movie . I would n't suggest spending much money on it , but if you do see this movie , make sure it 's with plenty of witty , like - minded buddies .
This movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the Troma movies ( with which it shares certain qualities ) . The humour is rough and ready but fast and furious . If the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds do n't make you <unk> with boredom , reach for the six - pack of beer and enjoy the best " Chucky " film yet .
I just finished this movie and my only comment is " OH ! WOW ! " . Jennifer Beals is ok as the <unk> , but <unk> Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite ! Having watched her in <unk> , I was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen.<br /><br />I got ta see THIS movie again .... if only for <unk> Butler as <unk> !
This movie was amazing . Never before have I seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one . There is no <unk> , sugar <unk> , or glorifying heroine . This movie shows the true struggles , pain , and loss people go through when dealing with this drug . Good film , decent emotionally packed acting , and a great storyline . A much <unk> /><br / >
Simply one of the greatest films ever made . Worthy of sitting alongside such European <unk> as THE <unk> OF THE GAME , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 8 1/2 , <unk> OF <unk> , <unk> , THE NIGHT OF THE <unk> STARS , LA <unk> , <unk> , THE <unk> OF <unk> OF <unk> , THE FOUR <unk> <unk> and <unk> DE ... Both a blessing ... and an almost perfect work of art .
It has very little to do with the books : half of the characters have been eliminated , the plot has been greatly altered , people 's parents are changed for different characters . . .<br /><br />However , if you watch it as an independent piece ( try and forget you ever read the books ) the movie is very well put together , everyone is very good looking , and there is even a sweet ending ...
Burt Reynolds stars as an undercover cop who is after a crime boss .. Rachel Ward as the high price call girl he falls for .. Burt does well in this role and I think he would 've done well in more roles like this .. <br /><br <unk> Ward is beautiful and sexy in her part .. good pacing and story but something is missing in the equation .. on a scale of one to ten .. 7
Do n't hate Heather Graham because she 's beautiful , hate her because she 's fun to watch in this movie . Like the hip clothing and funky surroundings , the actors in this flick work well together . Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up the screen . The minor characters - <unk> <unk> { sigh } and Patricia <unk> are as <unk> as they are gorgeous . Congratulations Miramax & Director Lisa Krueger !
I first saw this on Thames television and loved it . I subsequently saw a dreadful write - up by someone who certainly had n't watched or listened to it . So , I bought a copy and then I bought another copy ! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD . The Australian version is great , but this one is better ! I might buy another .............
As i watched " <unk> <unk> " i could nt but laugh at what was taking place on screen . <unk> sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played <unk> in <unk> was 10 years old . Then the actor changed age to like 20 to play <unk> when he was a senior in <unk> ... but whatever , i thought it was funny .
A brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state . So painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment ( from the preparation of the <unk> to the victim <unk> in his own pants before dying ) it has the power to change your mind about death penalty . The whole <unk> originated from this story : the <unk> screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused .
One of the best ever . Direction , <unk> , a thrilling and dramatic history , wonderful soundtrack and , most of all , the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn , the best and most underestimated " <unk> generation " actor . After seeing this movie i guess if there 's anyone who could n't have any doubt about giving death to another man , in spite of the ugly things he could have done ?
A very good movie about anti - <unk> near the end of WWII . The scene that really speaks loudly of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest is giving his speech against the " international money <unk> and <unk> " . It sounds amazingly like the speeches that Adolph Hitler used to force down his peoples ' throats , yet none of the meeting <unk> seem to make this comparison .
<unk> <unk> was <unk> /><br />We opted for mass appeal.<br /><br />We want the best possible viewing range so , we <unk> profit and continue our manual labor jobs gladly to entertain you for working <unk> /><br <unk> Texas tale , please write about it ... If you like it or not , if you like Alex or not , if you like <unk> , Texas or Texas tale ... Just write about it.<br /><br <unk> opinion rules .
This is one of Peter Sellers ' best movies . Why is it never shown on TV or movie theaters ? Will it ever be released as a home movie ? Is it too <unk> for the medical field ? I would love to see this movie again . I would like my son , who is a doctor , to see it . <unk> is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this .
This is the worst <unk> movie ever , quite possibly the worst movie of all time ! Joe D'Amato is of course no cinematic genius but many of his movies are interesting and watchable . <unk> this is not one of them . Its cheesy and boring .... <unk> boring . If you want a movie to <unk> , get Troll 2 , if you want a movie to put someone into a coma , get deep blood !
usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a <unk> descending pattern . This bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive . The acting , save for the male antagonist , was awful . The plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene , which is probably good as performance art , but it was wasted in this movie . Not sure why this movie was made .
A ditzy girl ( yes , ditzy is about as complex as her character gets ) wo n't take no for an answer and does quirky things to get her husband back . It 's too far - fetched to be believable with such flimsy characters going through the motions . But not far - fetched enough to be fascinating in the way that say , Being John <unk> , was . So it ends up boring.<br /><br <unk>
Kinda boring , kinda gross , kinda unsettling , this was n't horrible , but not too good . There 's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life , though , props to this scene . Not much happens , and the movie just feels sort of <unk> . I was happy when it ended , and do n't believe anything about this being a true story .... very surprised this is <unk> around 6 .
This movie is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen in my life ! The acting is laughable and Corman has not improved his <unk> any since 1978 . 90 % of the special effects are lifted from <unk> ( 1978 ) , Up From The <unk> ( 1979 ) and <unk> From The Deep ( 1979 ) . It makes <unk> II : The <unk> look like it belongs on the American Film Institute List .
Perhaps the worst of the " Nemesis " films ( and that says A LOT ! ) , this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you 've seen them both , even if you 've only endured this entry . Making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value . In other words , they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake .
I thought it will be a Ok movie after seeing the commercials about it . It was funny at some parts and some very nasty . The only person I felt sorry for is Horatio <unk> who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women . But he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film .
This movie was pretentious , <unk> and just down right not funny . The filming technique reminded me of MTV . I am a fan of Hartley . But what was he thinking of ? So much more thought could have gone into this movie , considering the subject matter . This could have been a true <unk> battle over good and evil , but Hartley , it appears used the stand technique of <unk> out the viewer .
Not bad performances . Whoopi plays the wise / warm role quite well . Still , the storyline and situations can not be believed ( forced PC stereotypes ) . At times it is good Jews and Blacks vs. the evil White Christians ( ho - hum ) . A typical Hollywood fantasy . The film does have its moments , but it is not one that I would recommend to go out of your way to view .
.... is the boob in the pie . Every thing else in it is an abortion , a <unk> failure of a film . At least you can SEE and <unk> what goes on in an Ed Wood movie ( usually ) . High schools drama clubs do better than this on a routine basis . Once you 've you 've seen the breast pie bit , you can turn it off and go watch " Hannibal " .
Each guy Liv Tyler meets loses their head over her , not , of course , without some small <unk> from Liv . Liv is at her beautiful best , with Matt Dillon tops among the <unk> . Interesting initial premise , to tell story from perspective of each <unk> , degenerates into sitcom - style finale ( not unlike Blame It On Rio , with which it has more than a few similarities ) . Worth watching nonetheless .
" Capt . <unk> 's <unk> " is an old fashioned Hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity , and supposedly no Americans . The story takes place on a Greek island during WW2 . The Italians arrive to take over the island , but with German supervision . There is a romantic triangle made up of a Greek couple and the Italian captain . Nice performances by all the actors ; Penelope Cruz 's best work yet .
This was the best movie ever has seen on " <unk> 's <unk> Club " ( <unk> <unk> ) This movie is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century . It cause a very good impression to all the partners of " <unk> 's <unk> Club " . I recommend this movie to all the fans of Troma and to all the people who like the good movies , not the commercial movies .
This movie is <unk> and would probably appeal to children today , even if there is n't a Jedi in the entire thing . Of course , Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too . Even Mickey Rooney is good ; so are Anne <unk> and Angela Lansbury . The world was a different place when this movie was released , and it certainly is a great place to visit .
Forget all those people who tell you it 's not as good as the book . So what ? This is a film after all . It is a sheer joy to watch , made entirely on location in <unk> , gorgeous photography but with dark , disturbing moments as well . The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as captain <unk> . Apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise .
A precursor to " Citizen Kane " in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon , here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of <unk> flashbacks . In Spencer Tracy 's 15th film he already looks middle - aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be <unk> /><br />A little silent - screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable , well - written drama .
as with many of Wong 's films , a lot of people find them to be boring and confusing . Well i like them and i like this film too . I went out and rented it on dvd and i watched it 3 times . It is a very subtle movie that provides an <unk> experience . for those who did not enjoy it ...... you just wasted 2 hours of your life .... too bad ... <unk> .
This is definitely Nolan 's most <unk> , and thought - provoking piece . Not to say that <unk> or <unk> are bad , but they were definitely up to more Hollywood standards ... while Following is more of an indie flick . The story is very brilliant , and very well developed . Overall ... watch this if your a fan of any of Nolan 's work , I'm sure you 'll be able to appreciate it more .
This is a classic that will be able to hold up with drama 's to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70 's style and it 's a story about the 70 's . It is funny , action - filled , entertaining and sad at the same time . It has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions . 4 STARS !
This is one of my most favorite movies of all time . Pretty pathetic you say ? Well , yeah it is . But Chris is incredibly , incredibly funny . His innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films . Look at both motel scenes , when Spade gets caught with his <unk> down , and the other : " JUST GO AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ! ! ! "
Ali G <unk> has got to be one of the funniest films I 've seen in a long time , and Cohen 's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious . This film has cult classic written all over it , and it features some really great lines . Ali G <unk> is a good - time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end . Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real .
An interesting movie with <unk> Brewster as a young woman who travels to Europe in an attempt to find out what became of her older sister ( Cameron Diaz ) who mysteriously died years earlier . Brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting , such as having her <unk> find and start a romance with her dead sister 's much older boyfriend ( Christopher <unk> ) . Still , mostly good . <unk> : B
This is a low grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a <unk> . It may have some long - term significance as a snapshot of 1950s US thinking , but there is little else to commend in the mawkish storyline , wooden acting and grating style . There are some interesting photos of long - gone aircraft , but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen for the full length .
The first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable , especially with Jean Smart , but it really <unk> after that . This is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all . I know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self , but I found this kid <unk> irritating and <unk> .
If you are in search of a masochistic thrill , rent this movie , and show it to a group of your friends sober . This movie is just plane lame , but there not completely without value . The brief tits are nice , and there is one victim 's death that is funny as hell . Other than that , this is straight garbage . But it is still better than " Grim " or " <unk> "
This is a movie with a wonderful concept , but very weak writing . It should never have been released with out at least three more re - writes ( assuming it got any ) . The story is too <unk> held together , and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie . It would be great to see what a decent screen - writer could do with the story .
It was a fun film to look at . Though the chance this happened in your street is small , there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell . The simplicity of the film and the humour DO work . I must admit that you do n't have to see it in a theater ; it will do very well on a small TV - set . <unk> : see it with some close friends .
The Great <unk> is a beyond - excellent film . Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism . The anti - Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end , with its values , is one of filmdom 's great moments . Throughout this movie , I <unk> there was some higher form of intelligence , beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking , at work .
A wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups . Yes , they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff . This all under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them <unk> by the surroundings with long wide shots . It is great to see that there is lust in the mid - life crises <unk> .
Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast , loud and moody . Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence . Lots of blood , steel , silver , burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction . IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you , Blade even has a ' dodge the bullets ' sequence .
Eric <unk> 's ability to roll from character to character in this ' one man show ' exhibits his true range as a character actor . Each persona has their own message to convey about truth , society , class , drugs , etc . This is an absolute Must Have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting ! His performance contains some of the most Hilarious and Real moments I have ever experienced as a viewing audience .
Amazing , one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom . Guess I can take some pride in not liking what " the general populace " tends to go for . Jackie Mason is hilarious in this movie , and so 's Randy Quaid . I can never get enough of his " strong - arm " tactics , just like in Moving . He was also notable in National Lampoon 's Christmas Vacation . Love that guy .
Like an earlier <unk> , I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story , splendid acting , and dramatic musical score . It certainly contains some of Sam Waterston 's finest work . He and the writers depict <unk> not simply as an unjustly victimized hero -- which he was -- but also as naive , fond of alcohol , and snobbish , a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype .
This is a cute film starring <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from the " Our Gang " comedies . Set in the South during the Civil War , it may seem a little odd to see <unk> as <unk> 's slave , but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast . This was the only Our Gang feature film , and I highly recommend it over The Little <unk> remake from 1994 .
* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Well , seeing as I am a major H : <unk> fan , maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would . However , this movie is still excellent . It had tons of surprises , and it gave some more closure to the series . While I was sad that <unk> turned into a murderer , the overall feeling I felt was satisfied .
This movie is breath - taking and mind - blowing . But I think maybe it can only be appreciated by die - hard RPG <unk> . It is like a game . One problem is the plot is too game - like and just has too many twists . The twists are excessive . Jude Law gives a very good performance . I really like him in this movie , just as Jerome in <unk> and <unk> Joe in <unk>
This is NOT your run - of - the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases . The episodes , so far , are more realistic and <unk> /><br />If you are looking for something with a lot of butt - kicking Rambo - style cop story , you will not find it here.<br /><br />I gave it a 9 . I wish this series lives long . Morse is excellent !
When I saw this movie for the first time I did n't believe my own eyes . In front of me there was a great -and well <unk> parody of Valentino ... see Stan Laurel <unk> that way is like to see an excellent <unk> in action ! It 's a very good parody , rich of ideas , with a clever and charming Stan ... old and good like whiskey . ( or the booze - up after that )
This very forced attempt to <unk> Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino ( who is wildly overrated himself ) is neither informative nor entertaining . The character development is arbitrary and unbelievable -- especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy , as other reviewers have noted . Also , a couple of humorous moments aside , the film is not as funny ( black humor or otherwise ) as the director seems to think it is .
In this Silly <unk> , a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city . Most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table . The animation is fine , where this short suffers is in a lack of humor . Perhaps I 've just seen this " dinner table adventure " in one too many Tom and Jerry shorts . Even though this came first , I just did n't find it that enjoyable .
Despite the fact that the plot follows the well - known recipe of " who did it " , which has <unk> all the Perry Mason movies so far , the characters of the present film are not so well - developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood . Of course , in general , the Perry Mason movies are not significant , but , even for their low standards , this one is weak .
After seeing Forever Hollywood , it would be natural to want to see a John Waters film . At least , one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema <unk> who have experienced the unique cinematic <unk> of perhaps the best known non - mainstream director . It 's worth the effort , and <unk> is a lot better than Eraserhead , and there is a certain campiness about his films which his followers find <unk> .
ok , i am really into King 's stuff , but this is just dreadful . the whole movie , i am waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power . i can tolerate the worst of movies , as anything is better than watching a cut movie with commercials in it . but this takes the cake . i gave it a 2 , and i would never recommend it to anyone .
A desperate attempt to make a " film - noir " sci - fi thriller , but the movie falls short . It has no believable plot , some of the key actors were a joke ( NOT Lars <unk> , he is cool ! ) . I did like the " access <unk> by <unk> <unk> " though . I finished it on principle , but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life ...
" <unk> " would have to rate as one of the ten worst films I have ever seen . The writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and I 'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film.<br /><br />It fails to work either as a tribute to Belushi 's unique talent , or as an accurate account of his short life . < br /><br />A pointless mess with no redeeming features .
After seeing this piece of crap you will know why the <unk> drive on the left side of the street ... this movie is an absolute NO - <unk> ! The jokes ( if this is the right word for it ... ) are mostly sub - standard ( about 98 % ) and do miss any punch - line at all . Save the money and get drunk . You might enjoy this movie being totally wasted , perhaps !
Chen <unk> lost his sense of tempo . I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears , because it is painful to do : slow , <unk> heavy , and over - deliberate . But Westerners , on the other hand , suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation , which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun .
With " Anatomy " the german film producers have tried to make something totally new . Usually there just drama or comedy movies - in the horror genre <unk> was ) totally new at that time.<br /><br />The story 's also new and shocking . Franka Potente plays her role brilliant and I bet you wo n't find out who 's the murderer . It 's possible , but difficult . A really great movie with a lot of talented actors .
Sam <unk> 's " Ninja 3 : The <unk> " mixes martial arts with " The Exorcist " like horror . The horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable , but the film works as a mindless action / martial arts flick . The fight scenes are well - choreographed and exciting , and the film is never boring . So forget stupid dialogue , lame acting and annoying soundtrack - grab some beer and check this one <unk> recommended !
Great book , great movie , great soundtrack . Frank Sinatra shows in this movie that when he wanted to put the effort in , he could act . The ending is a bit schmaltzy , but for the time it 's understandable the studio wanted a happy ending . The graphic nature of the heroin addiction ( groundbreaking for the period ) is a plus . Add the terrific soundtrack and you 've got one of the great American movies .
It 's amazing what you can do with little money . DEAD <unk> being a low budget movie delivers its promises . < br /><br />Too bad we do n't see Rob Lowe more often on the silver screen . Lowe is at its best in this riveting thriller . No wonder he went from DEAD <unk> straight to the TV mega hit The West Wing . < br /><br <unk> <unk> 8 out of 10 < br /><br <unk> Toronto .
Little <unk> <unk> to Fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the <unk> <unk> . As I was extremely tired that evening , I was hesitant to see it , but the raving overall score of 9 here at IMDB made me go there.<br /><br />It was 80 minutes of pure life - force ! <unk> <unk> <unk> life through his own telling was <unk> /><br <unk> IT ! And if possible ... see it at a cinema !
The story of how the ( communist ) leader who freed the <unk> from Belgium <unk> was eliminated by the Western powers through the hand of <unk> . A story of struggle and injustice , of hope and the search of freedom . The story could be the one of any African country . A very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty . If you have to see only one foreign film this year , see this one .
<unk> , <unk> is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy . Robin <unk> gives a fantastic performance as Marcy suffering from <unk> 's <unk> , getting <unk> and <unk> as the movie progresses . This movie is not very optimistic and it 's very hard emotional , but at the same time very romantic . It 's hard to explain , but see it and find out for yourself . It 's definitely worth it .
While the movie has its flaws , it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy . It makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives , their struggles and a potential leader <unk> San <unk> <unk> . It makes one wonder why our government will <unk> places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help .
Ignore everyone else 's comments for this movie and watch it on pay cable ( like I did ) or rent it . You owe it to yourself . This film is what movies are ( supposed to be ) all about . Hard to categorize ( and God knows how this was pitched as a " high concept " ! ) , but this is one for the angels . Check it out . What have you got to lose ?
This Movie is really an entertaining , good clean fun movie , for the kiddies . <unk> by Nickelodeon 's talented Amanda ) is the sidekick to a <unk> boy who has a hard time telling the truth . He eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen . I wo n't bore you with the details . If you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie , I highly recommend this one .
A refreshing black comedy starring some of Australia 's finest . In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 Smoking <unk> captured the funny side of London gangsters , Two Hands rips through the Sydney underworld . It would n't be so funny if it was n't so close to the <unk> /><br />An Australian classic . If Australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on .
This one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and <unk> Wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere . <unk> come in and out of nowhere , the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer 's motivation is unclear to say the least . Maybe they could get away with this in a porn version , but here some more <unk> is needed .
I ca n't really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie . A woman meets a man , he wants to play games , she too , but only until she realise what she 's missing . She leaves , and that 's it really . It took 9 1/2 weeks before Elizabeth ( Kim Basinger ) left John ( Mickey Rourke ) . She should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery .
This is better than the early Cronenberg horror films , but nothing more than your basic what - is - real story . The <unk> theme has been told before too . Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere ( which is not that strong here ) with the amusing sexual references and Shore 's dark score . The story never grabs your full attention . It just flows forward event after event with boring pace . Rating 4/10 .
This was so poor I had to turn it off in the end . I have never watched such a pathetic film . I love B movies and was looking forward to more of the same but was sadly disappointed.<br /><br />This has the worst acting / plot / direction / writing , etc ...... of anything I have ever seen in my <unk> /><br />My advice to anyone thinking or watching / buying / renting , do n't go there !
If I 'm to like a movie , I need to care about the lead characters and what happens to them . In this waste - pod of a film , I found myself hoping that they would all die in the end . None of the characters are people that you 'd ever want to meet , they all made me sick . If not for a few nude scenes , I would have given this wretched movie a 1 .
I think it was <unk> Truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies , or the agony of making movies . This flick is definitely of the first type . <unk> and Juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish . The zany <unk> <unk> this Shakespearian <unk> is <unk> . I do n't think I 've laughed so hard since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail . It 's that good !
The <unk> is a typical British comedy for the period . To someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a London <unk> the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old <unk> /><br />The <unk> however comes into its own for <unk> boys like myself or their wife 's who know what these poor individuals are going through . And find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters .
The <unk> sequences ( as well as the Special Effects ) are Brilliant , in this movie . Michael <unk> must be one of <unk> BEST <unk> Co - <unk> of all time . The explosion in the <unk> , is a wonderful combination of <unk> , Special Effects AND <unk> Effects . The Director HAD an idea , that the Crew managed to create on film.<br /><br />Besides that ; Donald Sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film .......
_ <unk> _ is a long film for its genre , and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by Western audiences . That being said , I enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains . Some of the scenery is truly breathtaking , and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive _ <unk> _ with minimal use of the fast - <unk> /><br / >
Now this is classic . A friend of mine told me about this flick , saying that it 's incredibly lame , stupid , retarded , and moronic . He also said that I 'd love it . < br /><br />To my surprise , I found it available from <unk> and rented it at once . I 'm just shocked that I had never heard of it before . If I could give it an eleven , I <unk> /><br / >
Drew Barrymore gets second chance at high school , on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter . In flashbacks , we see that the first time around was , to put it mildly , a major disaster . David Arquette is amusing in modest role as Drew 's brother , who also <unk> to help out <unk> . Lots of subplots <unk> but never overwhelm simple charm of movie . Drew keeps making her niche as major innocent - sexy light comic actress .
" The Falcon & the <unk> " offers some of the best acting from its two leads . Hutton , in a brilliantly understated role , calmly portrays the confusion and angst of a man who seemingly turns traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father . Penn , as the co - <unk> basically just along for the ride and drug - money , <unk> turns in one of the strongest performances of his multi - talented career .
This movie coming from Turkey where you ca n't find any tradition of horror movies . First I was afraid of watching just an adaptation but after seeing it I have changed my mind . It has original scenario . A love movie using horror <unk> . Most of the players are not famous young people but their performance is <unk> that a new generation is coming . Maybe this is a sign that <unk> cinema is coming back after 20 years .
I 've sat through several <unk> Shore movies , but this is the only one that I 've liked . Of course , it helps that he is far less irritating than usual , perhaps even a little likeable . The rest of the cast does a fine job , especially underrated Carla <unk> . The film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy , and although few of the jokes are especially funny , the film is quite entertaining overall .
Our story : Two U.S. Navy deep sea <unk> search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the Filipino coast . Our proof : Extremely dull entertainment at its best , with no plot in sight . Jim Brown is completely wasted , provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey . Richard <unk> is in his usual form . Don <unk> and Richard Pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions ! <unk> AWAY ! ! !
Somehow , this documentary about Miles manages to include very little music and no complete tunes . Though Miles appears in the film , 95 % of the interviews are other folks , not Miles . There are huge chronological gaps , many aspects of his life ( his childhood prodigy , his drug addiction ) are skipped or glossed over , and you 'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking . Skip it .
I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after seeing this movie ! I was expecting a Biblical story <unk> with great special fx , etc . but during the film I found out that this was an absolute disaster ... it was n't biblical at all ... only the boat and the animals were similar to the story ... if you want a visual ' translation ' of the Bible version of Noah then DON'T go watch this movie !
Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash , and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in English class . This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen . It totally ignores and <unk> any themes it may present , so the story is just really really dull . Thank god the 80 's are over , and god save whatever man was actually born as " James Bond III " .
I 'm not going to say too much as this movie is n't worth the effort . To put it simply the movie absolutely sucked ! This is the worst movie I have ever seen . The storyline was stupid , you could n't follow what was happening , the characters were so annoying especially the main guy . I wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it 's <unk> /><br />Very , very bad .
This is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history . The invention gags by Carrot Top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history . I am not familiar with his other work , but if it is half as bad as this then I am just going to cry . I give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars , and may God have mercy on the souls of those responsible .
Not as bad as 1992 's " <unk> " ( where Hopper plays an " unstable " cop ) but pretty bad . How can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong ? This film manages to find a way . The story was pretty stupid and Hopper 's direction seemed like he had never directed before . All of the long shots in the beginning were bothersome . Lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue .
4 out of 10.<br /><br />This film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even <unk> <unk> any kind of emotion into the characters . Eugene Levy is probably the most funny .... The rest of the cast do their jobs , but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled . This just was n't very much fun , despite being funny at times.<br /><br / >
Unfortunately , this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels . Universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s , which were pale imitations of the original . The intelligent Egyptologist <unk> has been replaced by a leg - dragging Frankenstein in mummy <unk> , who exhibits no signs of intelligent life . This film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen The Mummy ( 1932 ) , you will be disappointed .
Reading the other two comments , I had to wonder if I had seen the same movie!<br /><br />Perhaps life is drastically different in Australia , but , wow - call it sci - fi or fantasy , but people just do n't act like this.<br /><br />I could n't pass up this review without commenting on it myself .. it gets better after the first half hour , but I doubt most could make it that far .. <br /><br <unk> .
< br /><br />Never ever take a film just for its good looking title.<br /><br />Although it all starts well , the film suffers the same <unk> you see in B - films . Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film , so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is <unk> /><br />A film to be listed on top of the garbage list.<br /><br / >
A film is beyond all expectations , an excellent insight into the human condition . What exactly drives <unk> to have her ass painted . What could push a human so far that there only way to escape is to have there rear passage repeatedly painted by <unk> /><br />This film is not afraid to <unk> <unk> in the face of the ass painting issue . Simply breathtaking . Roll on the sequel or whatever comes next from the geniuses who made this .
i saw this before ' <unk> ho - <unk> ' at the <unk> film festival in <unk> . everything about it is either <unk> the hat to ( or completely ripping off ) <unk> <unk> . i enjoyed it nonetheless , even if it is extremely derivative . what most impressed me was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe - string budget . the set design and the props were inventive and original , although the script definitely was not .
These guys combine low - brow with low - budget . It 's <unk> /><br <unk> if you want Bergman , rent " 7th Seal " or something . If you want to see gross - out humor and exploitation sex , this is the one.<br /><br />I think Jane <unk> as Julia makes it all watchable . She can actually act ( really well ) , she 's a complete <unk> , and she does n't seem to feel above it all .
This is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it REALLY <unk> ! In case you have n't noticed : it 's based on a true story.<br /><br <unk> <unk> /><br />Imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once a SS officer in WW <unk> /><br />It 's a very intriguing story and I 'm really surprised the movie is rated a lousy <unk> here on <unk> /><br />my rate : 7
I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorites list . A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie . Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food . <unk> points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander <unk> and also to Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane , the impossibly boring <unk> . Truly a gem to be watched every Christmas .
<unk> Phillips , who in her own right has <unk> a great list of credits as a hard working Hollywood actress , shines in this third installment of <unk> and Village <unk> 's <unk> series . In this installment , the sexual innuendo has been toned down with <unk> showing a caring <unk> side towards a recently <unk> genius teen . <unk> delivers this role to the viewers with great panache ' . The action and stunts were the best in the series .
This film is utterly amazing . From the performances of Huppert , <unk> , and <unk> , to Haneke 's screenplay and direction there is not a single <unk> . The film may put some people off with it 's hard sexual subject matter and with it 's slower pace , but it really is a masterful piece of cinema ... so do not let it 's challenging ways keep you <unk> /><br <unk> , and deserving every award it won in Cannes !
This movie was fun ! Especially if your between 8 and 15 . Frankie <unk> and Amanda <unk> make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it . Paul Giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to ' get ' . My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it . Parents : No really bad words or any sex to worry about . <unk> it for the ' right ' crowd . <unk>
This movie is basically a spoof on Hitchcock 's Strangers on a train , which i thought was overrated anyway . The plot has Danny <unk> going to see Strangers and then thinking Billy Crystal wants them to swap murders , For Crystal to murder his mother and <unk> to murder his wife . Both <unk> and Crystal are great and so is <unk> 's mother . This is <unk> 's directorial debut and it 's better than the war of the roses .
What is the story what is it on the screen . At first I must say , do not touch this movie , it is for your own best ( it sucks ) . And really what is the story , in the beginning it seems okay but after ten minutes it all gets worse . And that is not all , you can hardly see what it is on the screen it is too dark all the time.<br /><br />Do not touch .
this could have been better , but it was alright ... it helped me get away from my boredom . I did nt even wanna see it , the only reason i wanted to rent it is because Jamie <unk> is in it .. he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie ... the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie ... i give it a 4 out of 10
The movie contains a very short scene of <unk> in a bathtub . She looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56 , but this is the only saving grace of the movie . Otherwise , it has a mindless , unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of <unk> 's appeal . The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway films and <unk> X comes across as a student 's imitation of the Greenaway style , without any of his inspiration .
Terrible direction from an awful script . Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus . <unk> accents all over the map . Unlike most of the other commenters I had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud , but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn - out shots of nude or scantily - clad young men , usually wet or <unk> with sweat , looking <unk> at each other .
Hmmm , started well , like a hybrid of X - Files & First Wave , unfortunately , if the mere notion of Da Vinci 's lost time machine is preposterous to you , then the final ' battle ' between one man with a pistol and 4 <unk> century monks armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem positively ridiculous <unk> only by poor acting , poor script and screenplay , or , in other words , giggle factor 5 captain .

This film has the language , the style and the attitude down ... plus greats rides from <unk> ( a world champ ) and the great Jerry Lopez . John <unk> as <unk> has the surf <unk> down , and the surfing scenes are still the best ever . A true classic that can be seen many times . <unk> <unk> is a babe , and Laird Hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world 's number one extreme surfer .
If you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen , you are a better <unk> than <unk> /><br <unk> the logic lapses , common - sense leaps , and credibility stretches ... <unk> need more than two <unk> /><br />P.S. : If one more film uses a location that is clearly <unk> , and claims that it is a different university ( in this movie 's case : Berkeley ) , I 'm going to lose it .
Even Mel Gibson could nt save this <unk> of a movie . This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Why would <unk> Gibson make a movie that I m sure he could nt sit and watch ? what was this ? A total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a <unk> lady , who was also on some heavy <unk> street drugs . For all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs ; you will love this movie .
This could have been a good biopic , but what a mess ! I had this film when I was a theater manager . When I put the film together , and watched it , I thought I had some reels out of order . As it turned out I did n't , and if I did , nobody would have noticed . I could n't figure out what 's going on ! Everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way !
Yes , it 's pure trash . It might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema ( like me ) to see <unk> babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours , but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this . Probably , this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism . I accept it though for its shock value , decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction .
This has got to be the worst horror movie I have EVER seen.<br /><br />I hated it so much I wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was . Normally bad movies are no big deal , but something about this one if you hated it .. you really hate it.<br /><br />If anyone liked this you probably enjoyed Baby <unk> , I thought I could never find a movie that was worse then that one .. I guess not .
My friend made me sit down and watch this film . This is out there material . " God the Devil , Heaven Hell ... and a restaurant thrown in for good <unk> /><br />Four guys and a <unk> . Who dies ? When and <unk> That 's the story . You 'll never guess the ending for this one . A skillfully realized little gem of Aussie cinema . Hats of to the team that made this one.<br /><br />10 out of 10 .
<unk> <unk> does a wonderful job depicting a conflicted bride , torn between the challenges that await her professionally , the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when in college ( inspired by a famous author ) and the safety of her <unk> marriage to a man she really does n't love . This movie is definitely worth <unk> as predictable as it may be , the acting is inspiring and real chemistry exists between <unk> <unk> and Malcolm <unk> Warner .
<unk> LOVE is surprisingly entertaining . While the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions , making for an overlong movie , it never fails to charm and <unk> itself . The several <unk> , one warmly reminiscent of <unk> <unk> , provide ample smiles , laughs , wisdom and tenderness . It all should n't work , and at times it certainly bumps along , but forgive its inconsistencies , sit back and have a good time . It 's a charmer !
This was a excellent back when it came out . It had some the best talent available and a funny story . Between <unk> Cameron and <unk> Ali , it was hard to choose who is <unk> , and add in Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names , and you get a blockbuster . Ok , a made for TV blockbuster , but none the less . If you can find this move , do n't miss it.<br /><br / >
So , Americans make t.v . series based on movies , whilst us Brits make films based on t.v . shows . It should never work , but on this occasion it does because of a sublime meeting of character and actor . <unk> are sometimes justly so , and Leonard <unk> was BORN to play <unk> . This is one of the great comic creations , kind of how Norman Bates would have turned out if he 'd been melancholic instead if murderous .
I 'll admit that the first time I managed to catch Sci - Fi 's " Sci - Fi Prime " was last week , but despite the fact that I was a huge <unk> fan coming into the experience , Farscape is now easily my favorite of the four shows.<br /><br />Unlike most modern Sci - Fi shows ( including , regrettably , the two new Star Trek series ) , this show manages to be fun without coming across as fodder for <unk>
First half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally I 'm not easy to scare , but second half of this thriller did n't work quite a well , but still very scary ! A good thriller , than use simple ways to make good horror . <unk> , set in Russia , unknown cast , and made in Europe . but still great fun , and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well !
Nicely filmed , a little uneven , " Nobody " is a good evening 's entertainment . The plot is simple enough -- three <unk> get into a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar , and it turns out to be much more than they bargained for . The acting is decent , and there are a few unexpected twists . Watch for the completely unbelievable ( like the 10 shot <unk> , and 25 shot semi - automatic <unk> ) .
This thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat . I saw it on video , some of the landscape at " the <unk> " might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen . Cast has Sandra Bullock , Ben Chaplin ( from " The Truth About Cats & Dogs " ) , Michael Pitt ( Henry Parker in " Dawson 's Creek " ) and Ryan <unk> ( ? ? ? ) .
I ca n't believe this is n't a huge cult hit . Perhaps people in 1968 , thinking of the <unk> as a silly factory - made pop band rip - off of the Beatles , refused to see it . That cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since . Do n't make this mistake . _ Head _ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate . It is very funny and very intelligent ( and very trippy ) .
<unk> to know that the director ( Sebastian <unk> ) was a young Venezuelan ( 28 ) and bored with so many predictable movies , I was delighted with the script showing so many small stories and cues spread here and there . Directed with black humor and taste , I loved the tension between the very <unk> <unk> and the very natural but beautiful Thompson . Each member of the gang deserves attention , Gil <unk> at his best . <unk> is remarkable .
Blade is a dark , gloomy , but <unk> vampire movie and is one of the best ones . A bit of gore , but nothing really that bad . Wesley <unk> played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires . Not really like <unk> , because that s too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and it 's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night .... <unk> at best <unk> /><br <unk> %
Golden Boy is <unk> humor ( bordering on <unk> ) in the guise of " educational moments . " The main character , <unk> , wanders around getting himself into the silliest situations involving women ... It 's just that he 's shy on the surface but <unk> everything until he can learn something from it . The most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his " education " , which are outright embarrassing , yet funny at the same time .
Valentine " <unk> " <unk> and Joe " The Judge " Kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of <unk> ! <unk> as they put the <unk> on international heroin <unk> , Polish <unk> , peeping <unk> , <unk> girlfriends , renegade dogs , and <unk> who are too lazy to bin their <unk> . Do n't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious , art house flick . This movie is 100 % action !
A wounded <unk> standing alone to protect three innocent lives . A devious woman <unk> a deadly plot . <unk> tension . Smart <unk> /><br />These are things we rarely if ever saw in the TV series , but this movie adds them all into the mix . While this is most certainly a Lone Ranger movie , it mixes up the formula just enough that those who grew tired of the series would probably still enjoy it . Definitely recommended for any fan .
This movie is truly amazing , over the years I have acquired a taste for Japanese Monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor . However this one reaches a new low , as it follows the adventures of Johnny <unk> ( ? ) , a young boy who controls a Giant Robot , and his fight against the evil <unk> Gang , who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their disposal .
After watching this movie on tv , I looked it up in the IMDB and imagine to my surprise a user rating of <unk> ! This is not a good film . Especially bad is the editing ; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction . It 's not very <unk> done . I do agree that the acting was fairly decent , especially Kelly <unk> , and that the story was intriguing enough .
< br /><br />This movie is <unk> incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry , the cliché are put on <unk> than 5-year old <unk> butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart , every single joke was badly timed and would n't have been funny if it were timed <unk> /><br />Don't see this movie , there 's a real chance you 'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again ... ever .
This meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting , even with Ed McMahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy . Jim Brown kicks ass effectively , Gloria <unk> proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles , and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who <unk> By the Book . It 's still dull and badly constructed , and even the print shown on cable is now <unk> of its original James Brown score .
Occasionally funny but generally boring . I did recognize Robert <unk> from Welcome back Carter ( aka <unk> ) as the ex - celebrity criminal . There is a knee slapping , gut busting scene with the French lady having a bad reaction to American food . S. Baio , S. Kellerman , and Tom Arnold are billed but have only minor roles . You never get to know the characters and it 's hard to care what happens to them . Not recommended .
Joan Fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave Cary Grant . After their marriage , she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt . It appears that Grant tries to scheme his best friend , Nigel Bruce , out of part of his life savings . Bruce ends up murdered and Fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money . This drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale .
<unk> beyond comprehension , the HBO version of <unk> is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film . Some scenes simply do n't make sense in English and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading . Add in the self - censorship involving CIA operative Frank <unk> , and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power . Here 's hoping the subtitled version gets to American television screens at some point .
This is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen - it has no good features at all.<br /><br />It looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title <unk> /><br />The lead male transformed from deaths door to superman - eh you what < br /><br />Other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting.<br /><br />I left the cinema feeling <unk> /><br />Needless to say i could not <unk> this film to anyone
My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for Thanksgiving . I have rarely laughed so hard . This is a typical low - budget horror movie with dumb special effects , a worse plot , and even worse acting . But are you really expecting a classic when <unk> <unk> receives top billing ? I thought not.<br /><br />Since this movie does have some entertainment value , I give it a 3 out of 10 .
This is not a new film . It is a re - cut of 1994 's " Emmanuelle , Queen of the Galaxy " , and it has been significantly truncated . Warning : Many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie!<br /><br />If you want to see this one in its original form , pick up " Queen " - avoid this one at all costs , as the cuts make it even <unk> than it was originally .
Whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted , the script was dull . plodding and nothing we have not seen before . Not once in this film did I ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger . No noticeable climax and a very standard resolution . I believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest . After all , did n't EVERYONE on the planet see " Schindler 's List " ?
Some <unk> friends recommended this , but as a film it 's really lacking in originality . I found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes , and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning . However , if you like traditional English / <unk> ballads , it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one . I 've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie , with professional musicians filling in for the actors .
The movie seemed a little slow at first . But it picked up speed and got right to the point . It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the " <unk> " . I enjoyed it . It is very close to reality as any movie about the Atomic <unk> that were to be dropped on Japan . I have recommended it to friends . I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight <unk> .
I highly <unk> this movie . It <unk> the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed . The actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance . I loved the story line , the actors , everything . While I do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes , over - all the movie was impeccably done .
I saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic . It does well in portraying issues that the average High School student is subjected to . < br /><br />I left the movie feeling stunned and saddened and yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audiences regarding these issues ( bullying , rape , suicide and <unk> /><br />Its a Fantastic Aussie <unk> /><br />Go see it.<br /><br <unk> it.<br /><br <unk> from it .
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock , with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy , a kidnapped child , a nasty church , a foreign plot and some random <unk> . Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock , the story rips along to its cool climax at an <unk> function , but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock 's black and white , low - budget original . Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master 's stable .
I caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me . This was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen , yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next . Alan <unk> is an excellent " bad guy " but this character beats all others . I 've never been so affected by a movie ! It 's been 6 years and I still ca n't forget " Closet Land . "
Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever ! It is funny , and cool . Jason Shepherd ( Frankie <unk> ) proves that he was not lying and goes to Los Angeles to Get his paper back from Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) . Along with friend <unk> <unk> ) , mess up his life since Marty wo n't call <unk> ' dad and say he wrote the paper ! Yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch !
What would it be like to be accused of being a subversive ? This is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters , one being the accused subversive , the other being the <unk> . It is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end . This film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political governments thoroughly , you will never get the point of this film , as proved by 90 % of the reviews here .
This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made . Ulrich <unk> and Thomas Bo <unk> are hilarious , as they drive across Sweden . I do n't know how Ulrich <unk> does it , but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way . BUT if you do n't understand Danish ( I am not referring to your <unk> here ) do n't waste your time on this  I do n't think it would work with subtitles .
If you like horror or action watch this film <unk> . If the opening scene does n't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse . Great Action , excellent casting and top one - liners . This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop , kick & punch thrown . Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun . Its a pure rush of dark comic book action . 9/10
This is a pretty faithful adaptation of <unk> <unk> 's novel , " Black Rain . " Like the book it is very moving and thought - provoking . The story revolves around a couple 's attempts to see their niece successfully married . They are having trouble finding suitors because of a rumor that she suffers from radiation sickness , after walking through Hiroshima on the day of the bombing . Well filmed , well acted , moving , tragic , horrifying and funny .
Normally for movie reviews , I try to be constructive and objective , but there is only one word for this , uh , " film " : SUCKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The dialogue , acting , special effects , plot , set , and characters all seem as if they were made up by , well , my <unk> plants . Do n't see this , for the sake of all that is good and right in this world ! :)
This is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen - it has no good features at all.<br /><br />It looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title <unk> /><br />The lead male transformed from deaths door to superman - eh you what < br /><br />Other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting.<br /><br />I left the cinema feeling <unk> /><br />Needless to say i could not <unk> this film to anyone .
A fun filled romp , full of silly if not sometimes cruel jokes . Not the best of movies , but definitely well worth watching . David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming selves with Granger as an especially delightful and ingenious gentleman . Ava Gardner as wonderful as always , with such a delightful character that is absolutely <unk> . The story line is typical , but full of <unk> surprises , especially concerning the unconventional relationships between Granger , Gardner and Niven .
This is a true gem of a TV film . Based on a completely untrue story , it follows the course of the down - and - out football league club through their course in the English <unk> cup , where mayhem ensues and the players all sport seventies styles . The ending is unexpected , the performances are great , and Nick <unk> shows that he CAN do something other than host sports shows . My only regret is that I did n't tape it .
i honestly do nt know why so many people hate this movie , i have always thought that it was one of my absolute <unk> . the fight with tiger and his men rocked , the fight with the pirates with the <unk> rocked , the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure <unk> ... ok so it did nt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the <unk> were pretty good . i give it a 8/10 .
This movie was <unk> good ! It was hilarious ! There are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it . John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were awesome as Pete <unk> and <unk> ! I love those guys ! I love the adventures they went on , too . I definitely recommend this movie.<br /><br />Also , the music in this movie is terrific ! I love singing along with all of the songs !
This short , which won an Oscar , spawned two sequels and a TV cartoon show , has minimal animation but <unk> script ( by Theodore <unk> aka Dr. Seuss ) and <unk> more memorable and enchanting main character . <unk> <unk> a style of animation that even influenced Disney during the <unk> and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s . This is on of their finest . God to have it in print . Highly recommended .
This is a novelty in Danish film . The mood is not unlike that of <unk> <unk> , also by Anders Thomas <unk> , but with a novel touch . One difference is fewer characters , leaving much more room for them to be <unk> into . And what characters ? ! The two <unk> are perfect . <unk> <unk> is a dominating , deranged parody and <unk> <unk> <unk> an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an <unk> pairing of the two .
Not your ordinary movie , but a good one . Billy Bob is very funny in this movie , the way he talks , what he says etc . I was kind of surprised when i saw it , cause i just thought it was a normal comedy , but it was more than that . It had a very good story , great characters and a good <unk> /><br <unk> part : Probably when Billy Bob is running around in his robe shooting at the <unk>
This two - character drama is extremely well - acted and has a valid message and some <unk> shocking moments ( shocking not because they are graphic , but because you 're not prepared for them when they come ) . But eventually it does become oppressive , just like the somewhat similar " A Pure <unk> " did . Still , Alan <unk> should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his multi - dimensional performance , no doubt about it . ( * * 1/2 )
Along with Cops , The <unk> is one of Keaton 's two funniest shorts . Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made . This has an decent " plot " for a short , and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags . Keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict ( how the mistake happens is a classic ) and then must <unk> the authorities . Best gags - the bread line and t he " elevator " .
This is one of Stan Laurel 's best solo comedy 's , before the 1927 teaming with Oliver Hardy . Laurel is a very good actor in the film , and provides good comedy . The best scene in the film is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel ( his real - life common law wife ) , at the Cafe <unk> . Stan does silly dances that are funny , without you hearing the music . I will recommend this to any Stan Laurel fan .
This story takes place in Wisconsin . I was half heartedly watching my tape when I heard the name <unk> . I was n't sure where it was taking place until I heard them say Green Bay & then I figured it was Wisconsin . Watching further confirmed it.<br /><br <unk> awaiting the outcome I could really feel <unk> 's frustration . I did not know it was based on fact until the end . It left me glad but sad and wanting to know more .
The child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit . It was a pretty weak field for Best Picture that year . I think " Apocalypse Now " should have taken it , but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange , plus Vietnam was still too recent . Meryl Streep was tremendous , as always , playing a very unlikeable character . I do n't usually compliment directors , but I really liked that bit with the elevator doors . Grade : B
This HAS to be my guilty pleasure . I am a HUGE fan of 80 's movies that were designed to entertain and they did n't care if they offended anyone . This move has no meat , not substance , no deep thought provoking scenes . Just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown , then so be it ! This movie is for when you just want to relax and NOT think . Viva la nudity !
A fun romp ... a lot of good twists and turns !

Hank Azaria shows his talent again , Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... <unk> /><br />Definitely worth watching .
This movie will <unk> not go over well with some , because most of the horror is mental . But it does have a little something for almost everyone , including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens . The film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology , while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie . <unk> <unk> is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance .

This HAS to be my guilty pleasure . I am a HUGE fan of 80 's movies that were designed to entertain and they did n't care if they offended anyone . This move has no meat , not substance , no deep thought provoking scenes . Just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown , then so be it ! This movie is for when you just want to relax and NOT think . Viva la nudity !
This has got to be one of absolute worst movies I 've ever seen in my life . The writing and acting are just pathetic . It ranks right up there with Uncle Sam on the all time worst movies ever made . However , when I see crap like this able to make it to video , it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because I know I could do a better job than what the makers of Killers did .
Slasher sequel ( fourth <unk> PART MASSACRE film ) concerns a group of nubile <unk> stranded in a <unk> cabin in the snow , being offed by a deranged killer . Typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans , gore , wonderfully gratuitous female nudity , no plot . Though it wears out its welcome eventually , even at its short <unk> /><br <unk> star Brinke Stevens makes a cameo , which only seems to be there for the sake of including her in the movie .
John Candy and Eugene Levy star as inept security guards who chase down a big time mobster . <unk> is truly the right word for this alleged comedy ... a few laughs but mostly groans and thoughts to yourself like " why am I watching this <unk> ? " Yes that is Meg Ryan in this too .. which i am sure she does nt want to be reminded of .. a waste of a talented cast .. on a scale of one to ten .. 0
This has got to be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed . It is simply not funny and the scriptwriters have obviously just tried to use the name of the TV series in order to make a few quid at the box office . This film makes a carry on seem subtle as far as sexual innuendo goes ( no mean feat ) , and has all the charisma of a corpse with <unk> . A complete <unk> I 'm afraid ! !
Being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film , Street Fighter II : The Animated Movie , I was really looking forward to this <unk> /><br />However , it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose . Most of the characters I could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so <unk> /><br />There are some good points however , the Animation is superb ! ! !
A terminally dull mystery - thriller , which may sound pretty sound theoretically but plays out very poorly . The ludicrous script is full of ( MINOR SPOILER ) people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to , and the director does n't seem able to work up any energy and suspense . The gooey sequence that kind of " explains " the film 's title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film . ( * 1/2 )
To be fair , I could n't bear to watch this movie all the way thru , so I have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film . But the first 30 minutes or so are amongst the worst I have seen in a while . Children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written , acted , and directed slapstick humor , but adults in full control of all their <unk> should steer clear of this stinker .
This is a great film for pure entertainment , nothing more and nothing less . It 's enjoyable , and a vaguely feel - good movie.<br /><br />A minor , but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we do n't know why Justine and <unk> broke up . Okay , most first relationships do n't work for one reason or another , but they more or less seemed like a nice <unk> /><br />In a nutshell , it 's worth a watch to escape reality .
Once the slow beginning gets <unk> , the film kicks off and really becomes quite a lot of fun in many unexpected ways . The ensemble cast is really good , with Heather Graham perhaps being the weakest of them . Casey Affleck as her brother is really good and extremely likeable , if you catch my <unk> /><br />I highly recommend the film if you just want to have to good hours . <unk> should really enjoy this film - it says a lot about relationships .
<unk> recruit private Owens tests drill instructor Sgt Moore 's ( Jack Webb ) skills . No explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex . It is set at the <unk> 's <unk> Island <unk> boot camp and most of the cast were actual Marines . <unk> one - liners abound , and the closing credit 's " dedicated to ... " is intense . With such strong male and female characters , this movie could not be made in today 's touchy - <unk> world .
The greatest effort plus the finest cast ever assembled in a movie by The Director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon And Sean Penn on the front row . Someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by Tim Robbins but i convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon had give me a truly superb performance that i cried my heart out . Their acting is so real ! No doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5 !
I think this is a great , classic monster film for the family . The mole , what a machine ! The tall creature with the <unk> , the flying green <unk> , <unk> / <unk> or whatever they are and the ape men things the speak <unk> with them . The battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast <unk> ! yummy ! Class , what else can I say ? How would they make a 2002 remake of this one ?
Before this was shown on MTV or VH1 it was at my local theatre playing just before the main movie . I remember this short movie more than the film I saw that day . It was the first time I had ever a music movie like this , but I will tell you that seeing on the big screen from a 35 mm print in a <unk> theatre gives it a much better impact than seeing a <unk> pan and scan version on VH1 at Halloween .
I ca nt believe there are people out there that did not like this movie ! I thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen . It my have been b / c i am Mel Brooks biggest fan ... I know almost all the words and get very <unk> when they censor them , when it is played on a Family Channel . :) this is one of my favorite movies , so i do nt know why any one would disagree ! thanks <unk>
This is a funny , intelligent and , in a sense , realistic comedy about a 14-year - old trying to live her first love while on vacation , and also about the complex , sometimes amusing , sometimes touching , relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter ... and about how far a women ( not only Nicole , the teen - <unk> ) can go to get the man she loves ! I laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags .
I love comedies and I love independent films , but this was much too slow and the humor was extremely regional . I guess It would have been better if the main characters were likeable , but they were just typical <unk> - x slacker types , just like the people that have been causing trouble in high schools for forty years ... I can understand High <unk> for a young indie film - maker when it is deserving , but this is an extremely average film .
A big waste of time is all you 'll get out of this bag . I rented this hoping for a suspenseful movie with maybe a few believable scenes , but boy was I ever <unk> . I think the title should 've been " <unk> 101 " , or something to that effect . Well , anyway , stay the hell away from this film . It <unk> you to death . Do n't be afraid of big foot , be afraid of this crap ! !
They give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase . The main characters are involved in one constant stand - off where they threaten each other , every five minutes or less . And I 'd like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the A. Garcia bit . It 's like some local cop walking Charlie Manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee . Get real !
I do n't see why everyone loves this film so much . True , it does have good intentions and meaning , but you can not compensate for such a poor script . Woody Allen is a brilliant <unk> , but I 'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage . It 's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible . I happen to be a huge Woody Allan fan and love most of his work , but this I can not recomend .
Every now and then some amateur will come out with a tired piece of action film making . this one is just so wrong I do n't think i even need to comment about the plot , acting , script , camera work . because it have none ! ! If putting a muscle guy in cool leather jacket walking in slow - mo and throw in a funky rap song is the main ingredient of making a great action movie , then <unk> action movie ! !
Enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that I wish it turned out better . Everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise , but it 's too deep a vision , too involved attempt at <unk> mental delusion to survive a transition to the screen . It is an attempt to capture the <unk> of <unk> patterns on celluloid -- the result is muddled and slow . I give it a 10 for effort , but a 5 overall .
This is a silly movie with much singing and dancing . Acting is average , but writing leaves something to be desired . There are <unk> performances by Buddy <unk> , with a short but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy . A totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating <unk> of Alice in Wonderland . Many parts are worth watching , but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie
Dennis Hopper must 've been really hungry to do this movie . <unk> special effects , very poor writing , cheesy dialogue , stupid - looking killer bio - robots . Never mind the <unk> disregard for science . The awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off . The best part of this movie was the pull - start cyber - penis on the <unk> - out cyborg pirate captain . 2 out of 10 stars because I 'm in a generous mood .
I saw Grande <unk> at its world premiere on the <unk> Film Festival . I had no idea what I was entering and if I 'd had any idea I would n't have entered . This is the most pretentious film I 've seen for a long time . It tries to be provocative , yet deep , with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes - it does n't succeed ! It 's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen . 4/10
" <unk> : <unk> to be <unk> " is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original , " Madonna : Truth or <unk> " . Julie Brown 's brilliant creation <unk> Madonna 's highly entertaining documentary ( although it was n't exactly daring , insightful , <unk> , or truthful ) with a faithfulness to detail , right down to the packaging . I highly recommend this for Madonna fans , Julie Brown fans , or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody .
This is actually the first movie I ever saw in a theatre , where the people did n't leave immediately when the end credits started . In stead they remained seated for a few minutes , gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite , trying to understand what they ' ve just seen.<br /><br />The only thing I can say : Try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible ( so did I ) ! . I gave it a 10
<unk> and <unk> was one of the funniest films of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival . From the UK , it is about a young crowd of <unk> and their various relationship <unk> . Much of the humour is centred around a new - <unk> men 's self - help group where they pass around various implements like the ' rock of truth ' . They also go on a ' hunter <unk> ' weekend with hilarious results . Trust me , you 'll laugh your teeth out .
Despite a silly premise , ridiculous plot devices and low budget , <unk> Trap < br /><br <unk> to be striking . An inventive , beautifully scored film , a must see . You have to throw <unk> out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do If you can manage that , you will be in for a pleasant surprise . Also take note that this is one of the few semi - classic horror films that was n't spoiled by numerous sequels .
" Dead Man Walking " is a piece of incredible filmmaking . All the acting is top - notch and realistic , and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides , paying equal homage to both . Above all , this is a deeply moving story of redemption , of death with dignity and loss of ego . Any film that deals this <unk> and <unk> with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10 . Thank you , Tim Robbins !
Throw <unk> has n't dated at all , it 's as funny now as when it was released . A genuinely eccentric comedy , that does n't try too hard to be liked and is all the better for it , full of memorable laugh out loud lines . Even small characters are well written and beautifully played , like Billy Crystal 's best friend 's girlfriend , and a lovely cameo from Rob Reiner as Crystal 's agent . A little bit insane and a lot funny .
I have to confess that I slept in the cinema while watching the first <unk> movie ... but this one is simply <unk> ! It is really funny and it leaves the first one miles away . It has <unk> gags and funny situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and I only stopped laughing when I reached the car to return home . I repeat : this movie is spectacular ... <unk> is really funny and Cleopatra is a real babe ! !
<unk> John Osborne 's ( Look Back in <unk> , The <unk> ) <unk> of Oscar Wilde 's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original , perhaps too much so . Nonetheless , the dialogue , the acting , with a cast headed by Sir John Gielgud & Jeremy Brett , and the brilliantly cerebral production ( marred only by a " too quick " ending ) make this worth the while of any lover of Theater , with a capital " T " .
I loved this movie . It is a very simple plot and from what I understand it is based on a true story . Growing up in the 80 's with hard rock / hair metal may have something to do with my love of this film but even aside from the music it is a really fun movie to watch . Give it a try , you will like it unless you are the hardest of critics and only like movies of " Citizen Kane " caliber .
Riding high on the success of " Rebel Without a Cause " , came a <unk> wave of ' teen ' movies . <unk> this is one of the best . A very young <unk> excels here as the not really too troubled teen . The story concentrates more on <unk> of <unk> , than any traumatic occurrence . The supporting cast is memorable , Frankenheimer directs like an old pro . Just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously .
Valley Girl is the definitive 1980 's movie with catch phrases filtered throughout this wonderfully acted movie . The characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual " day - in - the - life " of any high school , USA . This flick is to the 1980 's what the Brady Bunch TV series is to the 1970 's . If you do n't like it , well then " <unk> me with a spoon . "
Interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern India . Features transparent special effects - elephants dressed in <unk> coats sporting <unk> <unk> . All this said , we do have a good story and a fine cast at work , and an exciting climax . It 's been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in India - courtesy of Robert <unk> , a master at ' padding . ' Given a choice , <unk> for the shorter version .
Another period piece for Chen <unk> ... ( ca n't remember him doing a modern <unk> ... <br /><br />Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises . None of the HK fighting scenes , or the Hollywood type of heroes , but it is good because of it . The characters are strong , I really felt for them.<br /><br <unk> the <unk> definitely gives the English subtitles the edge . The film is 3 hours , but it did n't feel like it .
This movie is the funniest danish movie I 've ever <unk> /><br />The plot is funny , surprising and <unk> . Danish humor is unlike any other , and it gets you every time . The entire audience laughed 90 % of the time .... it was incredible . The characters are so well played , and the two actors , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> play their best <unk> /><br />I would highly recomend <unk> this movie , you wo n't regret it , believe me :-)
I did nt know what to expect . I only watched it on a rainy <unk> afternoon on pay tv . Right from the start it drew me in . The music and settings and characters were excellent . I had nt heard of any of the actors but they all were outstanding . A wonderful thriller .<br /><br />Now that i ve read other comments on this movie referring to past versions and the book , i will be <unk> to find out more on this great movie
One of the most boring movies I 've ever seen . Three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their " love " of each other . They do n't seem to be interested in much but each other , and only <unk> so . I was left feeling shut out . Most of the exterior scenes take place at night , so one ca n't even enjoy well - lit sights of Paris ! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes .
<unk> <unk> is essentially , a movie to see only for the terrific <unk> sequences . Although there is a story here , Robert Redford 's character , a <unk> trying to make the U.S. Olympic team , is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all . Gene Hackman , in an early performance , adds nicely , but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off , and it would n't make much of a difference .
The first time I saw this film it was with this cute girl I was attracted to . we had a lot of fun laughing at it and generally making fun . So my impression was that it was terrible but watchable for <unk> value . Then , as part of our anniversary , we watched it together again on video . As it turns out , the movie is just terrible and unwatchable . It 's amazing how cute girls can change the way the world looks .
I love exotic science fiction / fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch . <unk> and images of child abuse , mutilated bodies ( live or dead ) , other gruesome scenes , plot holes , boring acting made this a <unk> experience , The basic idea of entering another person 's mind is not even new to the movies or TV ( An Outer Limits episode was better at exploring this idea ) . i gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice .
Heaven , Mary and all the Saints above ! A young man has got super sperm , it 's miracle <unk> , call the Pope , all you ladies out their desperate to get <unk> , line up out side his door and drop your marks and sparks finest ! <unk> retro <unk> comedy type comedy , trying to bring you a bit of the <unk> Irish charm . Has an effect like placing two fingers down your own throat , <unk> <unk> ! One out of ten !
This was the typical women prison movie . I thought the women were very sexy and the outfits were great . All the camera did was focus on the women and the women were always in provocative poses for the camera and they were always scantily <unk> I loved ) . This is your basic prison / breakout movie of the 70 's . All I can say about this film is that it 's extremely cheesy , but the women are gorgeous and their butts are great !
I have just watched this " latest " version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully fledged watchable movie.<br /><br />One note however , the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of <unk> as opposed to a full orchestral score . I think Paul <unk> needs to get his act together ! ! !
This is a very dull film with poorly developed characters , subplots that go nowhere , and barely tolerable acting . It comes across as a poorly conceived rip - off of " <unk> /><br />The only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects . But even that was n't enough to keep me from nodding off . I would like to get the soundtrack , especially the music during the space flight sequence , for nights when I have trouble falling asleep .
Every role , down to the smallest , has been cast and acted with <unk> /><br />The extraordinary <unk> Malone never takes a <unk> . Her two co - stars are equal to her in this film . Ryan <unk> may be the best actor of his generation . Chris Klein gives his best performance to date . This is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults . You 'll think and talk about this film for days . Highly recommended .
It was a movie that made ya think a little . Some parts a little cheesy , some parts pretty good . Plot did <unk> at times and just when you thought <unk> ( Sandra ) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead . All I got to say is that <unk> <unk> should have been in the whole movie . His character was the best , very refreshing after all the crap <unk> went through . He would have lifted me and <unk> through the dumps .
Gray can make the English language jump through <unk> like none other . He <unk> a number of events , tied together by his writing of a manuscript ( the " Monster " of the title ) , some sad , some <unk> funny , all in his characteristic , sarcastic manner . If you liked " <unk> to Cambodia " you will love this one . I actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than " <unk> to Cambodia " . A real masterpiece .
I just re - watched this thriller , one I had previously believed to be one of <unk> 's lesser efforts . How wrong can you be ! Maybe because I 'm older , or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing , but now I think it 's amazing . Every bit of suspense is <unk> out of the <unk> detail , and that final scene on the merry - go - round is just breath - taking ! Perfect in every way , highly recommended .
This was easily one of the weirder of the Ernest movies , especially in regards to the production design . What was up with the pink guard uniforms ? Sadly , this film probably destroyed the Ernest series , turning the series into a straight - to - video series . However , Jim <unk> gave one of his better performances by playing Nash , his criminal alter ego . A <unk> in the series , but was n't too bad in most <unk> <unk> Man routine was classic )
<unk> 4 : This movie was continued after the 3rd <unk> movies . This one was released in the same years as <unk> 3 was released in 1991 . <unk> 4 takes you in space as they hunt for the humans in a space ship . I doubt if there will be a <unk> 5 because the ending for the 4th was quite a good ending , which brought the end to the <unk> as there was no more left . I give this movie 10 out of 10 .
If you like his show you might be a little disappointed . This movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show . The beginning sequence is really really silly and funny , and a great start . <unk> ! <unk> does make a cameo <unk> /><br />if you are a fan then watch it ! if you do n't know him or do n't like him then do n't bother . <unk>
I loved this movie , I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later , this evening I got to see it again . I really thought it had an interesting idea , they only thing that upset me was the ending which I felt was a cop out . ' Round here it 's hard to find this movie and I was lucky enough to have seen it on <unk> . I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore in here too !
We watched this movie in my chemistry class , so obviously it had educational value . I thought the film did a really good job of intertwining the subjects of the science , moral issues and personal experiences of the <unk> project , but was n't exactly focused on strong acting . I would recommend this movie for the <unk> inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind Fat Man and Little Boy , but if the subject of nuclear bombs bores you , do n't see it .
What a great cast for this movie . The timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines - several times I was still laughing minutes after they were delivered . I found <unk> From Heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things I was thinking would happen , the way they came together was anything but predictable . This movie is about hope and <unk> wrongs . I left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing . Bravo to the Five Sisters .
Yes , this is one of the greats of the black action genre . <unk> mixture of racist comedy and racist violence ( at times reaching a disturbing pitch , even for a fan of the genre ) this movie is n't your Shaft in the park . Wonderful bits of Rudy Ray Moore comedy stand up that do n't seem funny , at least not to a white boy like me , but great in context . Much better than its dissimilar sequel , " The Human <unk> "
A genius . My genius . I remember the exact second in 1994 . I was sat in a pub in <unk> , England . I recall the exact seat . " Bill Hicks dies of cancer " said the headline in the <unk> . I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach . Buy this DVD . If you do n't find something in it one way or the other I 'll be <unk> /><br <unk> Bill , I wish so much you were still here .
Another ' good overcoming evil ' story , but with a difference . This includes learning self - discipline . When Julie goes with her teacher to a Zen monastery , she learns about herself . She also <unk> her karate <unk> /><br />When the Zen monks visit the city , some awkward and comical moments ensue . Not uproarious , but entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />Next Karate Kid has much to say about looking within , and improving what is there -- as well as using what you have .
Lady and the Tramp II is very <unk> animated , and the songs , especially that of the <unk> Dogs , are quite good . However , the family seems even too idyllic , and I ca n't help understanding that <unk> is <unk> when everything is forbidden . However , I also pity Angel who never has had a loving family until she meets Jim dear and <unk> /><br />In any case , it 's clear that the original Lady and the Tramp is better than this sequel .
Jim <unk> 's performances as the <unk> Girl and <unk> are amazingly funny -- on a level <unk> Chaplin and Keaton . Linda <unk> is great in her once - in - a - lifetime role as the hometown <unk> waitress longing for adventure . Unfortunately , the remaining 90 % of the movie was <unk> bad due to the atrocious plot . The makers of Ernest Goes to Africa did not rise to the creative challenges inherent in low budget film production . Only worth seeing on cable .
I first saw this movie at a premiere - party in Mr. <unk> hometown <unk> . There , between directors , musicians and other Norwegian celebrities I laughed and laughed ... I just could n't stop . If you like a comedy with black humor , sharp lines and excellent acting - this is one flick you HAVE to see ! It 's like mixing " True Romance " with " The Wedding Singer " and add a dash of " Mad about you " <unk> /><br />10 <unk> !
Nothing special to see here , the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era . This film has an original story , but if it does n't have an original plot or characters , so in my opinion it 's not worth seeing . I 'm not saying that the movie was bad , it was just a typical anime story and I thought I watched this movie like a thousand times . So if you are looking for something original see another thing .
I own this movie . And it is terribly hard to find . It is a unique low budget little gore flick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion . It has the really <unk> low budget feel to it , and the gore is <unk> good for what appears to be a $ 500 budget . The director is claimed to be the master of gore . I would n't go that far , but maybe in his time he was . Overall 6/10 on the gore <unk> .
No <unk> <unk> is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of <unk> <unk> . But then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it . You feel cheated , embarrassed , and stupid . If you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it 's gay , give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his <unk> birthday .
Dennis Quaid is <unk> ' hard to prove us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a dumb guy . And he 's doing too much to prove it . TV sequences are very good , like a <unk> of old black and white <unk> . Music is fine too , because Mr. Lewis himself is singing . But the rest is just Hollywood B - Movie style , with the fifties Happy Days complex . I think the only good thing in this movie is to see young Winona Ryder .
This is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before . Not much action in this one though . Again it 's about the guy protecting the president . He 's macho - as usual , and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual . Does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president ? ! And then there 's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around . <unk> and predictable to the last toe - crumbling minute .
About 5 minutes into the movie you 're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there . The biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are . This is what 50 year old producers and out - of - touch Hollywood script writers think stoner life is like , as if they gave the cast of Friends some pot . <unk> , dull , annoying and completely unrealistic . I despise this movie .
This movie is <unk> directed by Clive <unk> , he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters . I think there is a sequel missing for this one , Barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring Lord of illusions , that is one I think was a real garbage . But I also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel <unk> has become a dark cult classic of horror films .
One of those films that I happened across through The Criterion Collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace . That turned out to be a great decision . I was almost <unk> by the quality of the film , the story it told and the way it was told . The almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film . This really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy .
What a script , what a story , what a mess !
More suspenseful , more subtle , much , much more disturbing ....

Just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - Veidt & Barrymore
This is a great movie . Too bad it is not available on home video .
a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention ... Ben Daniels is fascinating ( and courageous ) to watch .
This is a good film . This is very funny . Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films !

Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars . It is < br /><br <unk> , funny , and endearing
For pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the <unk> films . I highly recommend each and every one of them .
Absolutely fantastic ! Whatever I say would n't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves . Watch it now ! <unk> !
This is the greatest movie ever . If you have written it off with out ever seeing it . You must give it a second try .
If you like <unk> Shore , you 'll love Son in Law . If you hate <unk> Shore , then , well ... I liked it !
Without a doubt , one of Tobe <unk> 's best ! <unk> <unk> , great special effects , and The <unk> ( vamp me baby ! ) .
Brilliant . <unk> along with Citizen Kane , The Matrix and <unk> . Must see , at least for <unk> in her early days . Watch it .
Widow hires a psychopath as a <unk> . <unk> film noir thriller which does n't make much of its tension promising set - up . ( 3/10 )
Anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside & <unk> a couple . Great story.<br /><br <unk> is for people who ca n't handle drugs .
The Buddy Holly Story is a great biography with a super performance from Gary Busey . Busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job .
I caught this film late at night on HBO . Talk about wooden acting , unbelievable plot , et al . Very little going in its favor . Skip it .
This movie was so incredibly boring , Michael J. Fox could 've done so much better . Sorry , but it 's true for all you people who liked the movie
Very intelligent language usage of Ali , which you <unk> miss ! In one word : ( <unk> sentence ... ) Wicked , so keep it real and pass it on !
My first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women , <unk> not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending
The plot was really weak and confused . This is a true Oprah flick . ( In Oprah 's world , all men are evil and all women are victims . )
This movie turned out to be better than I had expected it to be . Some parts were pretty funny . It was nice to have a movie with a new plot .
The one - liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones . By far one of the best of this genre .
... an incomprehensible script ( when it should n't have been ) dependent on a rather <unk> voice - over.<br /><br />The animation , however , show real talent.<br /><br />Quite visually impressive .
If you are French native , then you find this movie extremely funny . It 's good , just good ! Can though imagine that subtitles or <unk> do n't mean much in english .
Complete entertainment ! Although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself does n't have them including the autumn characters ( mother and daughter ) the general concept rocks .
You may like Tim Burton 's fantasies , but not in a commercial - like show off lasting 8 minutes . It demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace .
This movie is based on the novel Island of <unk> . Moreau By H.G. Wells . It 's a fairly good one too , it 's at least better than the version by John Frankenheimer .
I do n't believe it ... Luc <unk> is not only a genius now ... he has always been one ... this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films ... just perfect !
1st watched <unk> - ( Dir - Tim Robbins ) : Very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty . <unk> more recognition and publicity than it received .
John Leguizamo 's " <unk> " is one of the funniest one - man shows I 've ever seen ! I recommend it to anyone ! Well , anyone with a good sense of humor ....
<unk> Matter : <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Stephen <unk> < br /><br <unk> : Phillip Glass < br /><br <unk> I died and gone to Heaven ? < br /><br />You will be <unk> .
I 've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie . Bad characters , bad story and bad acting . It would be a love story between a man and a mermaid . Really awful .
i really wanted this to be good as i am from Liverpool where it is set but it truly awful . the acting from everyone involved is <unk> the script is terrible <unk> terrible . terrible
Well , this movie actually did have one redeeming quality . It made up the funniest season one episode of <unk> I wish <unk> had released this one instead of " The <unk> Hand . "
In my opinion this is the best Oliver Stone flick -- probably more because of <unk> 's influence than anything else . <unk> stuff -- full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending .
The Claude Lelouch 's movie is a pretty good moment of cinema . One of the most touching films about family and loneliness , and surely the best interpretation of French actor Jean - Paul Belmondo .
A really realistic , sensible movie by Ramgopal Verma . No stupidity like songs as in other Hindi movies . Class acting by Nana Patekar . < br /><br />Much similarities to real ' encounters ' .
<unk> " Boy 's Own Paper " nonsense with a <unk> performance from Cushing , some amusing rubber monsters , colourful jungle sets , & the ever - welcome appearance of Caroline Munro in animal <unk> .
Excellent documentary that still manages to shock and enlighten . Unfortunately , times have n't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom - conscious Americans to see .
Leslie <unk> is a very talented actor , who made a huge mistake by doing this film . It does n't even come close to being funny . The best word to describe it is STUPID !
This movie is a real waste of time and effort . The film lacks plot and depth . The visuals are decent but nothing to write home about . There are far better films out there .
The movie is not that bad , Ringo Lam sucks . I hate when Van Damme has love in his movies , van Damme is good only when he does n't have love in his movies .
If it was n't for the terrific music , I would not hesitate to give this cinematic <unk> 2/10 . But the music actually makes me like certain passages , and so I give it 5/10 .
It 's not Citizen Kane , but it does deliver . <unk> , and lots of it.<br /><br <unk> acted and directed , poorly scripted . Who cares ? I did n't watch it for the dialog .
Wonderful songs , <unk> animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale . A nice British feel which sets it apart and above from the standard , saccharine sweet Disney cartoons .
This movie is so bad it 's almost good . Bad story , bad acting , bad music , you name it . O.K. , who are the <unk> that gave this flick a ' 10 ' ?
Why this worthless piece of French cinema has garnered any sort of attention , other than negative , is beyond me.<br /><br />Don't bother renting this one . It should n't have even come into this country .
i m sure he does nt need the money for a life saving operation or transplant . in all honesty i think this review qualifies as a better movie than ' <unk> ' . thanks for listening .
I do n't know why I even watched this film . I think it was because I liked the idea of the scenery and was hoping the film would be as good . Very boring and pointless .
Best club scenes that i have seen in a long time - atmosphere mesmerising - <unk> Rhys 's performance is impeccable and <unk> . i would recommend this film to any age group . watch out for <unk> !
I smiled through the whole film . The music is great . The story - telling is great . It 's a wonderful film . This picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties .
<unk> can to some people look a bit long but it 's one of rare real <unk> adventure film . It could be compare to <unk> <unk> with a bit of <unk> <unk> . You must see it .
Albert Pyun delivers a very good action / drama about a junkie who tries to rip - off a big crime - lord . A lot of style and many very cool actors . Burt <unk> is excellent .
Worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is <unk> but you have to see it really ! ! ! ! <unk> watch the <unk>
Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris are touching . This movie is really surprising . It was enjoyable from start to finish.<br /><br />The story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football <unk> /><br / >
Worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is <unk> but you have to see it really ! ! ! ! <unk> watch the <unk>
I found this movie really hard to sit through , my attention kept wandering off the tv . As far as romantic movies go .. this one is the worst I 've seen . Do n't bother with it .
This film contain far too much meaningless violence . Too much shooting and blood . The acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor . The only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars .
I thought this movie was horrible . I was bored and had to use all the self control I have to not scream at the screen . <unk> Squad was beyond cheesy , beyond cliche , and utterly predictable .
Pointless movie about making a movie . No where near the flesh shown in the original , which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music . Not here.<br /><br />It 's always fun seeing the <unk> guy though .
From a military historian 's standpoint , nearly everything in this movie is historically accurate . Beyond that , it is an enthralling story that leaves you depressed at the end but quite glad you took the time to watch .
A quite easy to watch tale of 2 thieves , with that love / hate type relationship between them . <unk> Walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than he 's letting on .
Yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame . Real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as <unk> war and <unk> are unreal . A moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making .
<unk> : <unk> error < br /><br />When Charlie walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a <unk> . After a few seconds we hear a loud bang from the same gun being fired .
Its the best movie I have seen in 2000 , it has the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman in it . It has a great storyline , cast and soundtrack . I enjoyed it very much . 10 out of 10
In my opinion , this film has wonderful lighting and even better photography . Too bad the story is not all that good and Mr. Cage sometimes loses his accent . But two thumbs up for lighting and the DP !
I have seen " Chasing the Dragon " several times and have enjoyed it each time . The acting was superb . This movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life .
Robert Carlyle excels again . The period was captured well and the soundtrack , although hearing modern techno in this period piece was a little disconcerting at first , proved to be very well <unk> /><br />Well worth a watch .
This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The only advantage seeing this movie is that the next movie ca n't possibly be worse . It 's childish as hell ( but Children are n't allowed )
Hartley on low - key form : Martin Donovan , born to play Jesus , comes as Messiah to <unk> <unk> ; P.J. Harvey is excellent as sidekick <unk> . A slight film , but <unk> amusing , short and sweet .
When the Italians and Miles <unk> work together nothing can go wrong ! As ever , Miles is great as the almost as great <unk> ; the most lovable <unk> of all times . Totally lives up to the first movie .
I do n't care if some people voted this movie to be bad . If you want the Truth this is a Very Good Movie ! It has every thing a movie should have . You really should Get this one .
Blondell & Farrell are excellent . Blondell was <unk> . This was very funny and I laughed often throughout it . Great dialogue and its loaded with wisecracks . I could 've watched it for hours . <unk> fun to watch .
One of those TV films you saw in the seventies that scared the hell out of you when you were a kid but still gives you an eerie feeling . No great actors or expensive production but <unk> that phone rings ......
The screen - play is very bad , but there are some action sequences that i really liked . I think the image is good , better than other <unk> movies . I liked also how the actors did their jobs .
Beautiful coming of age romance about an English boy and French girl who run off , and grow up.<br /><br />I saw this movie as a teenager and loved it . I saw it again this year and loved again.<br /><br / >
amazing movie . Some of the script writing could have been better ( some cliched language ) . Joyce 's " The Dead " is alluded to throughout the movie . Beautiful scenery and great acting . Very poetic . Highly recommend .
The distribution was good , the subject could have been <unk> and comic . whereas , he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving <unk> . Instead of this , the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy .
Young <unk> fake accent was difficult to accept at times.<br /><br />The show was billed as mystery / <unk> but should have been listed as a romance.<br /><br />Don't rent this one if you are sleepy , it will knock you out .
To anyone who likes the TV series : forget the movie . The jokes are bad and some topics are much too sensitive to laugh about it.<br /><br />We have seen much better acting by R. <unk> in " <unk> 8 " .
A wonderful story about the consequences of obsessive love with the beautiful romantic back streets of Paris as its location . We 're transported through time and see the plot develop from the perspectives of the three main characters as the mystery <unk> .
I 've seen several of these body <unk> type movies , but none was nearly as bad as this one.<br /><br />No thrill , no FX , bad acting , bad photography , bad sound , bad everything.<br /><br <unk> <unk> <unk> all !
I ca n't believe this movie has an average rating of 7.0 ! It is a <unk> bad movie , and I saw it when it was fairly new , and I was in the age group that is supposed to like it !
all i can say about this film is to read the back of the video case and then put it back on he shelf and pick anything else , i mean anything , a blank video , would be better than watching this .
Me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day , we picked one each and one of us picked <unk> . Lets just say that from now on , we never let him pick a movie . This movie sucks
What a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco in this exciting action picture . Although the characters and the story are in fact bad , it still has a certain cult - flair .
< br /><br <unk> is simply David Cronenberg 's best movie . All the people compare it to the Matrix . They 're not even similar . If you enjoyed Cronenberg 's other works just a little bit , you 'll love this one ...
The <unk> : A Detective Story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it . Carrie - Anne Moss plays Trinity in this animated cartoon . I really like the ' Private Detective ' ideas created by the Director .
An excellent " sleeper " of a movie about the search for Carlos the international assassin . Am surprised this film did n't <unk> in $ <unk> - plus because it 's much better than most films that do so . Rent it NOW .
Nice way to relax . I am packing my suitcase now so I can go and be with Caroline <unk> . <unk> monsters and scenery make for 89 minutes of harmless fun . Something you can enjoy with your family and not be offended .
An extremely powerful film that certainly is n't appreciated enough . It 's impossible to describe the experience of watching it . The recent UK television adaptation was shameful - too ordinary and bland . This original manages to <unk> itself in your memory .
I could nt believe how well this kid did on screen , you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie . It is like watching home movies with a twist . I recomend this to everyone . Highly .
What a script , what a story , what a mess !
More suspenseful , more subtle , much , much more disturbing ....
Just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - Veidt & Barrymore
This is a great movie . Too bad it is not available on home video .
a mesmerizing film that certainly keeps your attention ... Ben Daniels is fascinating ( and courageous ) to watch .
This is a good film . This is very funny . Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films !
Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars . It is < br /><br <unk> , funny , and endearing
For pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the <unk> films . I highly recommend each and every one of them .
Absolutely fantastic ! Whatever I say would n't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves . Watch it now ! <unk> !
This is the greatest movie ever . If you have written it off with out ever seeing it . You must give it a second try .
